Introduction
============

There are several different time-evolution methods currently
implemented in Castro. As best as possible, they share the same
driver routines and use preprocessor or runtime variables to separate
the different code paths.  These fall into two categories:

-  Strang-splitting: the Strang evolution does the burning on the
   state for :math:`\Delta t/2`, then updates the hydrodynamics using the
   burned state, and then does the final :math:`\Delta t/2` burning. No
   explicit coupling of the burning and hydro is done. Within the
   Strang code path, there are two methods for doing the hydrodynamics:

   -  Corner-transport upwind (CTU): this implements the unsplit,
      characteristic tracing method of :cite:`colella:1990`.

   -  Method of lines (MOL): this discretizes the space part of
      our system without any characteristic tracing and uses an
      ODE integrator to advance the state. Multiple stages can be done,
      each requiring reconstruction, Riemann solve, etc., and the final
      solution is pieced together from the intermediate stages.

-  SDC: a class of iterative methods that couples the advection and reactions
   such that each process explicitly sees the effect of the other.  We have
   two SDC implementations in Castro.

.. index:: castro.time_integration_method, USE_SDC

The time-integration method used is controlled by
``castro.time_integration_method``.

  * ``time_integration_method = 0``: this is the original Castro method,
    described in :cite:`castro_I`.  This uses Strang splitting and the CTU
    hydrodynamics scheme.

  * ``time_integration_method = 1``: this is a method-of-lines integration
    method with Strang splitting for reactions.

  * ``time_integration_method = 2``: this is a new implementation of
    the spectral deferred corrections formalism, under development,
    that will soon support 4th order (space and time) coupling of
    hydro and reactions.

  * ``time_integration_method = 3``: this is the original SDC method that
    uses the CTU hydro advection and an ODE reaction solve that sees the
    effects of the hydro to couple reactions and hydro to second order.
    Note: because this requires a different set of state variables, you
    must compile with ``USE_SDC = TRUE`` for this method to work.  We call
    this method "simplified-SDC".

Several helper functions are used throughout:

-  ``clean_state``:
   There are many ways that the hydrodynamics state may become
   unphysical in the evolution. The ``clean_state()`` routine
   enforces some checks on the state. In particular, it

   #. enforces that the density is above ``castro.small_dens``

   #. normalizes the species so that the mass fractions sum to 1

   #. resets the internal energy if necessary (too small or negative)
      and computes the temperature for all zones to be thermodynamically
      consistent with the state.

.. _flow:sec:nosdc:

Overview of a single step (no SDC)
==================================

(``castro.time_integration_method`` = 0 or 1)

The main evolution for a single step is contained in
``Castro_advance.cpp``, as ``Castro::advance()``. This does
the following advancement. Note, some parts of this are only done
depending on which preprocessor directives are defined at
compile-time—the relevant directive is noted in the [ ] at the start
of each step.

#. *Initialization* (``initialize_advance()``)

   This sets up the current level for advancement. The following
   actions are performend (note, we omit the actions taken for a retry,
   which we will describe later):

   -  Sync up the level information to the Fortran-side of Castro

   -  Do any radiation initialization

   -  Initialize all of the intermediate storage arrays (like those
      that hold source terms, etc.).

   -  Swap the StateData from the new to old (e.g., ensures that
      the next evolution starts with the result from the previous step).

   -  Do a ``clean_state``

   -  Create the MultiFabs that hold the primitive variable information
      for the hydro solve.

   -  For method of lines integration: allocate the storage for the
      intermediate stage updates, ``k_mol``, and the ``Sburn``
      MultiFab that holds the post burn state.

   -  Zero out all of the fluxes

#. *Advancement*

   The update strategy differs for CTU vs MOL:

   -  CTU: Calls ``do_advance to`` take a single step,
      incorporating hydrodynamics, reactions, and source terms.

   -  MOL: Call ``do_advance_mol`` ``MOL_STAGES`` times
      (i.e., once for each of the intermediate stages in the ODE
      integration). Within ``do_advance`` we will use the stage
      number, ``mol_iteration``, to do an pre- or post-hydro
      sources (e.g., burning).

   In either case, for radiation-hydrodynamics, this step does the
   advective (hyperbolic) portion of the radiation update only.
   Source terms, including gravity, rotation, and diffusion are
   included in this step, and are time-centered to achieve second-order
   accuracy.

   If ``castro.use_retry`` is set, then we subcycle the current
   step if we violated any stability criteria to reach the desired
   :math:`\Delta t`. The idea is the following: if the timestep that you
   took had a timestep that was not sufficient to enforce the stability
   criteria that you would like to achieve, such as the CFL criterion
   for hydrodynamics or the burning stability criterion for reactions,
   you can retry the timestep by setting ``castro.use_retry`` = 1 in
   your inputs file. This will save the current state data at the
   beginning of the level advance, and then if the criteria are not
   satisfied, will reject that advance and start over from the old
   data, with a series of subcycled timesteps that should be small
   enough to satisfy the criteria. Note that this will effectively
   double the memory footprint on each level if you choose to use it.

#. [AUX_UPDATE] *Auxiliary quantitiy evolution*

   Auxiliary variables in Castro are those that obey a continuity
   equation (with optional sources) that are passed into the EOS, but
   not subjected to the constraint on mass fractions (summing to one).

   The advection and source terms are already dealt with in the
   main hydrodynamics advance (above step). A user-supplied routine
   ca_auxupdate can be provided here to further update these
   quantities.

#. *Radial data and [POINTMASS] point mass*

   If ``castro.spherical_star`` is set, then we average the state data
   over angles here to create a radial profile. This is then used in the
   boundary filling routines to properly set Dirichlet BCs when our domain
   is smaller than the star, so the profile on the boundaries will not
   be uniform.

   If ``castro.point_mass_fix_solution`` is set, then we
   change the mass of the point mass that optionally contributes to the
   gravitational potential by taking mass from the surrounding zones
   (keeping the density in those zones constant).

#. [RADIATION] *Radiation implicit update*

   The ``do_advance()`` routine only handled the hyperbolic
   portion of the radiation update. This step does the implicit solve
   (either gray or multigroup) to advance the radiation energies to the
   new time level. Note that at the moment, this is backward-difference
   implicit (first-order in time) for stability.

   This is handled by ``final_radiation_call()``.

#. [PARTICLES] *Particles*

   If we are including passively-advected particles, they are
   advanced in this step.

#. *Finalize*

   This cleans up at the end of a step:

   -  Update the flux registers to account for mismatches at
      coarse-fine interfaces. This cleans up the memory used during
      the step.

   -  If ``castro.track_grid_losses`` is set, then we
      also add up the mass that left through the boundary over this
      step. [1]_

   -  Free any memory allocated for the level advance.

Main Hydro, Reaction, and Gravity Advancement (CTU w/ Strang-splitting)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(``castro.time_integration_method`` = 0)

The explicit portion of the system advancement (reactions,
hydrodynamics, and gravity) is done by ``do_advance()``. Consider
our system of equations as:

.. math:: \frac{\partial\Ub}{\partial t} = -{\bf A}(\Ub) + \Rb(\Ub) + \Sb,

where :math:`{\bf A}(\Ub) = \nabla \cdot \Fb(\Ub)`, with :math:`\Fb` the flux vector, :math:`\Rb` are the reaction
source terms, and :math:`\Sb` are the non-reaction source terms, which
includes any user-defined external sources, :math:`\Sb_{\rm ext}`. We use
Strang splitting to discretize the advection-reaction equations. In
summary, for each time step, we update the conservative variables,
:math:`\Ub`, by reacting for half a time step, advecting for a full time
step (ignoring the reaction terms), and reacting for half a time step.
The treatment of source terms complicates this a little. The actual
update, in sequence, looks like:

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   \Ub^\star &= \Ub^n + \frac{\dt}{2}\Rb(\Ub^n) \\
   \Ub^{n+1,(a)} &= \Ub^\star + \dt\, \Sb(\Ub^\star) \\
   \Ub^{n+1,(b)} &= \Ub^{n+1,(a)} - \dt\, {\bf A}(\Ub^\star) \\
   \Ub^{n+1,(c)} &= \Ub^{n+1,(b)} + \frac{\dt}{2}\, [\Sb(\Ub^{n+1,(b)}) - \Sb(\Ub^\star)] \label{eq:source_correct}\\
   \Ub^{n+1}     &= \Ub^{n+1,(c)} + \frac{\dt}{2} \Rb(\Ub^{n+1,(c)})\end{aligned}

Note that in the first step, we add a full :math:`\Delta t` of the old-time
source to the state. This prediction ensures consistency when it
comes time to predicting the new-time source at the end of the update.
The construction of the advective terms, :math:`{\bf A(\Ub)}` is purely
explicit, and based on an unsplit second-order Godunov method. We
predict the standard primitive variables, as well as :math:`\rho e`, at
time-centered edges and use an approximate Riemann solver construct
fluxes.

At the beginning of the time step, we assume that :math:`\Ub` and :math:`\phi` are
defined consistently, i.e., :math:`\rho^n` and :math:`\phi^n` satisfy equation
(`[eq:Self Gravity] <#eq:Self Gravity>`__). Note that in
Eq. \ `[eq:source_correct] <#eq:source_correct>`__, we actually can actually do some
sources implicitly by updating density first, and then momentum,
and then energy. This is done for rotating and gravity, and can
make the update more akin to:

.. math:: \Ub^{n+1,(c)} = \Ub^{n+1,(b)} + \frac{\dt}{2} [\Sb(\Ub^{n+1,(c)}) - \Sb(\Ub^n)]

Castro also supports radiation. This part of the update algorithm
only deals with the advective / hyperbolic terms in the radiation update.

Here is the single-level algorithm. The goal here is to update the
``State_Type``  StateData from the old to new time (see
§ \ `[soft:sec:statedata] <#soft:sec:statedata>`__). We will use the following notation
here, consistent with the names used in the code:

-  ``S_old`` is a MultiFab reference to the old-time-level
   ``State_Type`` data.

-  ``Sborder`` is a MultiFab that has ghost cells and is
   initialized from ``S_old``. This is what the hydrodynamic
   reconstruction will work from.

-  ``S_new`` is a MultiFab reference to the new-time-level
   ``State_Type`` data.

In the code, the objective is to evolve the state from the old time,
``S_old``, to the new time, ``S_new``.

#. [strang:init] *Initialize*

   #. In ``initialize_do_advance()`` :

      #. Create ``Sborder``, initialized from ``S_old``

   #. Check for NaNs in the initial state, ``S_old``.

#. *React* :math:`\Delta t/2` [``strang_react_first_half()`` ]

   Update the solution due to the effect of reactions over half a time
   step. The integration method and system of equations used here is
   determined by a host of runtime parameters that are part of the
   Microphysics package. But the basic idea is to evolve the energy
   release from the reactions, the species mass fractions, and
   temperature through :math:`\Delta t/2`.

   Using the notation above, we begin with the time-level :math:`n` state,
   :math:`\Ub^n`, and produce a state that has evolved only due to reactions,
   :math:`\Ub^\star`.

   .. math::

      \begin{aligned}
          (\rho e)^\star &= (\rho e)^\star - \frac{\dt}{2} \rho H_\mathrm{nuc} \\
          (\rho E)^\star &= (\rho E)^\star - \frac{\dt}{2} \rho H_\mathrm{nuc} \\
          (\rho X_k)^\star &= (\rho X_k)^\star + \frac{\dt}{2}(\rho\omegadot_k)^n.
        \end{aligned}

   Here, :math:`H_\mathrm{nuc}` is the energy release (erg/g/s) over the
   burn, and :math:`\omegadot_k` is the creation rate for species :math:`k`.

   After exiting the burner, we call the EOS with :math:`\rho^\star`,
   :math:`e^\star`, and :math:`X_k^\star` to get the new temperature, :math:`T^\star`.

   Note that the density, :math:`\rho`, does not change via reactions in the
   Strang-split formulation.

   The reaction data needs to be valid in the ghost cells. The logic
   in this routine (accomplished throuh the use of a mask) will burn
   only in the valid interior cells or in any ghost cells that are on a
   coarse-fine interface or physical boundary. This allows us to just
   use a level ``FillBoundary()`` call to fill all of the ghost cells
   on the same level with valid data.

   An experimental option (enabled via
   ``use_custom_knapsack_weights``) will create a custom
   distribution map based on the work needed in burning a zone and
   redistribute the boxes across processors before burning, to better
   load balance.

   After reactions, ``clean_state`` is called.

   At the end of this step, ``Sborder`` sees the effects of the
   reactions.

#. [strang:oldsource] *Construct time-level n sources and apply*
   [``construct_old_gravity()``, ``do_old_sources()`` ]

   The time level :math:`n` sources are computed, and added to the
   StateData ``Source_Type``. The sources are then applied
   to the state after the burn, :math:`\Ub^\star` with a full :math:`\Delta t`
   weighting (this will be corrected later). This produces the
   intermediate state, :math:`\Ub^{n+1,(a)}`.

   The sources that we deal with here are:

   #. sponge : the sponge is a damping term added to
      the momentum equation that is designed to drive the velocities to
      zero over some timescale. Our implementation of the sponge
      follows that of Maestro :cite:`maestro:III`

   #. external sources : users can define problem-specific sources
      in the ``ext_src_?d.f90`` file. Sources for the different
      equations in the conservative state vector, :math:`\Ub`, are indexed
      using the integer keys defined in ``meth_params_module``
      (e.g., URHO).

      This is most commonly used for external heat sources (see the
      ``toy_convect`` problem setup) for an example. But most
      problems will not use this.

   #. [``DIFFUSION``] diffusion : thermal diffusion can be
      added in an explicit formulation. Second-order accuracy is
      achieved by averaging the time-level :math:`n` and :math:`n+1` terms, using
      the same predictor-corrector strategy described here.

      Note: thermal diffusion is distinct from radiation hydrodynamics.

      Also note that incorporating diffusion brings in an additional
      timestep constraint, since the treatment is explicit. See
      Chapter \ `[ch:diffusion] <#ch:diffusion>`__ for more details.

   #. [``HYBRID_MOMENTUM``] angular momentum


   #. [``GRAVITY``] gravity:

      For full Poisson gravity, we solve for for gravity using:

      .. math::

         \gb^n = -\nabla\phi^n, \qquad
               \Delta\phi^n = 4\pi G\rho^n,

      The construction of the form of the gravity source for the
      momentum and energy equation is dependent on the parameter
      ``castro.grav_source_type``. Full details of the gravity
      solver are given in Chapter \ `[ch:gravity] <#ch:gravity>`__.


   #. [``ROTATION``] rotation

      We compute the rotational potential (for use in the energy update)
      and the rotational acceleration (for use in the momentum
      equation). This includes the Coriolis and centrifugal terms in a
      constant-angular-velocity co-rotating frame. The form of the
      rotational source that is constructed then depends on the
      parameter ``castro.rot_source_type``. More details are
      given in Chapter \ `[ch:rotation] <#ch:rotation>`__.

   The source terms here are evaluated using the post-burn state,
   :math:`\Ub^\star` (``Sborder``), and later corrected by using the
   new state just before the burn, :math:`\Ub^{n+1,(b)}`. This is compatible
   with Strang-splitting, since the hydro and sources takes place
   completely inside of the surrounding burn operations.

   Note that the source terms are already applied to ``S_new``
   in this step, with a full :math:`\Delta t`—this will be corrected later.

#. [strang:hydro] *Construct the hydro update* [construct_hydro_source()]

   The goal is to advance our system considering only the advective
   terms (which in Cartesian coordinates can be written as the
   divergence of a flux).

   We do the hydro update in two parts—first we construct the
   advective update and store it in the hydro_source
   MultiFab, then we do the conservative update in a separate step. This
   separation allows us to use the advective update separately in more
   complex time-integration schemes.

   In the Strang-split formulation, we start the reconstruction using
   the state after burning, :math:`\Ub^\star` (``Sborder``). There
   are two approaches we use, the corner transport upwind (CTU) method
   that uses characteristic tracing as described in
   :cite:`colella:1990`, and a method-of-lines approach. The choice is
   determined by the parameter ``castro.time_integration_method``.

   #. CTU method:

      For the CTU method, we predict to the half-time (:math:`n+1/2`) to get a
      second-order accurate method. Note: ``Sborder`` does not
      know of any sources except for reactions. The advection step is
      complicated, and more detail is given in Section
      `[Sec:Advection Step] <#Sec:Advection Step>`__. Here is the summarized version:

      #. Compute primitive variables.

      #. Convert the source terms to those acting on primitive variables

      #. Predict primitive variables to time-centered edges.

      #. Solve the Riemann problem.

      #. Compute fluxes and update.

      To start the hydrodynamics, we need to know the hydrodynamics source
      terms at time-level :math:`n`, since this enters into the prediction to
      the interface states. This is essentially the same vector that was
      computed in the previous step, with a few modifications. The most
      important is that if we set
      ``castro.source_term_predictor``, then we extrapolate the
      source terms from :math:`n` to :math:`n+1/2`, using the change from the previous
      step.

      Note: we neglect the reaction source terms, since those are already
      accounted for in the state directly, due to the Strang-splitting
      nature of this method.

      The update computed here is then immediately applied to
      ``S_new``.

   #. method of lines

#. [strang:clean] *Clean State* [``clean_state()``]

   .. raw:: latex

      \MarginPar{we only seem to do this for the MOL integration}

   This is done on ``S_new``.

   After these checks, we check the state for NaNs.

#. [strang:radial] *Update radial data and center of mass for monopole gravity*

   These quantities are computed using ``S_new``.

#. [strang:newsource] *Correct the source terms with the n+1
   contribution* [``construct_new_gravity()``, ``do_new_sources`` ]

   Previously we added :math:`\Delta t\, \Sb(\Ub^\star)` to the state, when
   we really want a time-centered approach, 
   :math:`(\Delta t/2)[\Sb(\Ub^\star + \Sb(\Ub^{n+1,(b)})]` . We fix that here.

   We start by computing the source term vector :math:`\Sb(\Ub^{n+1,(b)})`
   using the updated state, :math:`\Ub^{n+1,(b)}`. We then compute the
   correction, :math:`(\Delta t/2)[\Sb(\Ub^{n+1,(b)}) - \Sb(\Ub^\star)]` to
   add to :math:`\Ub^{n+1,(b)}` to give us the properly time-centered source,
   and the fully updated state, :math:`\Ub^{n+1,(c)}`. This correction is stored
   in the new_sources MultiFab [2]_.

   In the process of updating the sources, we update the temperature to
   make it consistent with the new state.

#. *React* :math:`\Delta t/2` [``strang_react_second_half()``]

   We do the final :math:`\dt/2` reacting on the state, begining with :math:`\Ub^{n+1,(c)}` to
   give us the final state on this level, :math:`\Ub^{n+1}`.

   This is largely the same as ``strang_react_first_half()``, but
   it does not currently fill the reactions in the ghost cells.

#. [strang:finalize] *Finalize* [``finalize_do_advance()``]

   Finalize does the following:

   #. for the momentum sources, we compute :math:`d\Sb/dt`, to use in the
      source term prediction/extrapolation for the hydrodynamic
      interface states during the next step.

   #. If we are doing the hybrid momentum algorithm, then we sync up
      the hybrid and linear momenta

A summary of which state is the input and which is updated for each of
these processes is presented below:

Main Hydro, Reaction, and Gravity Advancement (MOL w/ Strang-splitting)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(``castro.time_integration_method`` = 1)

The handling of sources differs in the MOL integration, as compared to CTU.
Again, consider our system as:

.. math:: \frac{\partial\Ub}{\partial t} = -{\bf A}(\Ub) + \Rb(\Ub) + \Sb \, .

We will again use Strang splitting to discretize the
advection-reaction equations, but the hydro update will consist of :math:`s`
stages. The update first does the reactions, as with CTU:

.. math:: \Ub^\star = \Ub^n + \frac{\dt}{2}\Rb(\Ub^n)

We then consider the hydro update discretized in space, but not time, written
as:

.. math:: \frac{\partial \Ub}{\partial t} = -{\bf A}(\Ub) + \Sb(\Ub)

Using a Runge-Kutta (or similar) integrator, we write the update as:

.. math:: \Ub^{n+1,\star} = \Ub^\star + \dt \sum_{l=1}^s b_i {\bf k}_l

where :math:`b_i` is the weight for stage :math:`i` and :math:`k_i` is the stage update:

.. math:: {\bf k}_l = -{\bf A}(\Ub_l) + \Sb(\Ub_l)

with

.. math:: \Ub_l = \Ub^\star  + \dt \sum_{m=1}^{l-1} a_{lm} {\bf k}_m

Finally, there is the last part of the reactions:

.. math:: \Ub^{n+1} = \Ub^{n+1,\star} + \frac{\dt}{2} \Rb(\Ub^{n+1,\star})

In contrast to the CTU method, the sources are treated together
with the advection here.

The time at the intermediate stages is evaluated as:

.. math:: t_l = c_l \dt

The integration coefficients are stored in the vectors
``a_mol``, ``b_mol``, and ``c_mol``, and the
stage updates are stored in the MultiFab ``k_mol``.

Here is the single-level algorithm. We use the same notation
as in the CTU flowchart.

In the code, the objective is to evolve the state from the old time,
``S_old``, to the new time, ``S_new``.

#. [strang:init] *Initialize*

   In ``initialize_do_advance()``, set the starting point for the stage’s integration:

   #. if ``mol_iteration`` = 0: initialize
      ``Sborder`` from ``S_old``

   #. if ``mol_iteration`` > 0: we need to create
      the starting point for the current stage. We store this,
      temporarily in the new-time slot (what we normally refer to as
      ``S_new``):

      .. math:: \mathtt{S\_new}_\mathrm{iter} = \mathtt{Sburn} + \dt \sum_{l=0}^{\mathrm{iter}-1} a_{\mathrm{iter},l} \mathtt{k\_mol}_l

      Then initialize ``Sborder`` from ``S_new``.

   Check for NaNs in the initial state, ``S_old``.

#. *React* :math:`\Delta t/2` [``strang_react_first_half()`` ]

   This step is unchanged from the CTU version. At the end of this
   step, ``Sborder`` sees the effects of the reactions.

   Each stage needs to build its starting point from this point, so we
   store the effect of the burn in a new MultiFab, ``Sburn``,
   for use in the stage initialization.

#. [strang:oldsource] *Construct sources from the current
   stage’s state*
   [``construct_old_gravity()``, ``do_old_sources()``]

   .. raw:: latex

      \MarginPar{fix: gravity is still using {\tt S\_old}}

   The time level :math:`n` sources are computed, and added to the
   StateData ``Source_Type``. The sources are then applied
   to the state after the burn, :math:`\Ub^\star` with a full :math:`\Delta t`
   weighting (this will be corrected later). This produces the
   intermediate state, :math:`\Ub^{n+1,(a)}`.

   For full Poisson gravity, we solve for for gravity using:

   .. math::

      \gb^n = -\nabla\phi^n, \qquad
          \Delta\phi^n = 4\pi G\rho^n,

#. [strang:hydro] *Construct the hydro update* [``construct_hydro_source()``]

   The hydro update in the MOL branch will include both the advective
   and source terms. In each stage, store in ``k_mol[istage]`` the righthand 
   side for the current stage.

   In constructing the stage update, we use the source evaluated earlier,
   and compute:

   .. math:: \mathtt{k\_mol}_l = - \Ab(\Ub_l) + \Sb(\Ub_l)

   Each call to ``do_advance_mol`` only computes this update for
   a single stage. On the last stage, we compute the final update
   as:

   .. math:: \mathtt{S\_new} = \mathtt{Sburn} + \dt \sum_{l=0}^{\mathrm{n\_stages}-1} b_l \, \mathrm{k\_mol}_l

#. [strang:clean] *Clean State* [``clean_state()``]

   .. raw:: latex

      \MarginPar{we only seem to do this for the MOL integration}

   This is done on ``S_new``.

   After these checks, we check the state for NaNs.

#. *React* :math:`\Delta t/2` [``strang_react_second_half()``]

   We do the final :math:`\dt/2` reacting on the state, begining with :math:`\Ub^{n+1,(c)}` to
   give us the final state on this level, :math:`\Ub^{n+1}`.

   This is largely the same as ``strang_react_first_half()``, but
   it does not currently fill the reactions in the ghost cells.

#. [strang:finalize] *Finalize* [``finalize_do_advance()``]

   Finalize does the following:

   #. for the momentum sources, we compute :math:`d\Sb/dt`, to use in the
      source term prediction/extrapolation for the hydrodynamic
      interface states during the next step.

   #. If we are doing the hybrid momentum algorithm, then we sync up
      the hybrid and linear momenta

A summary of which state is the input and which is updated for each of
these processes is presented below:

Overview of a single step (with SDC)
====================================

We express our system as:

.. math:: \Ub_t = \mathcal{A}(\Ub) + \Rb(\Ub)

here :math:`\mathcal{A}` is the advective source, which includes both the
flux divergence and the hydrodynamic source terms (e.g. gravity):

.. math:: \mathcal{A}(\Ub) = -\nabla \cdot \Fb(\Ub) + \Sb

The SDC version of the main advance loop looks similar to the no-SDC
version, but includes an iteration loop over the hydro, gravity, and
reaction update. So the only difference happens in step 2 of the
flowchart outlined in § \ `2 <#flow:sec:nosdc>`__. In particular this
step now proceeds as:

2. *Advancement*

   Loop :math:`k` from 0 to ``sdc_iters``, doing:

   #. *Hydrodynamics advance*: This is done through
      do_advance—in SDC mode, this only updates the hydrodynamics,
      including the non-reacting sources. However, in predicting the
      interface states, we use an iteratively-lagged approximation to the
      reaction source on the primitive variables, :math:`\mathcal{I}_q^{k-1}`.

      The result of this is an approximation to :math:`\mathcal{A}(\Ub)`,
      stored in ``hydro_sources`` (the flux divergence)
      and ``old_sources`` and ``new_sources``.

   #. *React*: Reactions are integrated with the advective
      update as a source—this way the reactions see the
      time-evolution due to advection as we integrate:

      .. math:: \frac{d\Ub}{dt} = \left [ \mathcal{A}(\Ub) \right ]^{n+1/2} + \Rb(\Ub)

      The advective source includes both the divergence of the fluxes
      as well as the time-centered source terms. This is computed by
      ``sum_of_sources()`` by summing over all source components
      ``hydro_source``, ``old_sources``, and
      ``new_sources``.

   #. *Clean state*: This ensures that the thermodynamic state is
      valid and consistent.

   #. *Construct reaction source terms*: Construct the change
      in the primitive variables due only to reactions over the
      timestep, :math:`\mathcal{I}_q^{k}`. This will be used in the next
      iteration.

Note that is it likely that some of the other updates (like any
non-advective auxiliary quantity updates) should be inside the SDC
loop, but presently they are only done at the end. Also note that the
radiation implicit update is not done as part of the SDC iterations.

Main Hydro and Gravity Advancement (simplified-SDC)
---------------------------------------------------

(``castro.time_integration_method`` = 3)

The evolution in do_advance is substantially different than the
Strang case. In particular, reactions are not evolved. Here we
summarize those differences.

#. *Initialize* [``initialize_do_advance()``]

   This is unchanged from step `[strang:init] <#strang:init>`__ in the Strang algorithm.

#. *Construct time-level n sources and apply*
   [``construct_old_gravity()``, ``do_old_sources()``]

   This corresponds to step `[strang:oldsource] <#strang:oldsource>`__ in the Strang
   algorithm. There are not differences compared to the Strang
   algorithm, although we note, this only needs to be done for the first
   SDC iteration in the advancement, since the old state does not change.

#. *Construct the hydro update* [``construct_hydro_source()``]

   This corresponds to step \ `[strang:hydro] <#strang:hydro>`__ in the Strang
   algorithm. There are a few major differences with the Strang case:

   -  There is no need to extrapolate source terms to the half-time
      for the prediction (the ``castro.source_term_predictor``
      parameter), since SDC provides a natural way to approximate the
      time-centered source—we simply use the iteratively-lagged new-time
      source.

   -  The primitive variable source terms that are used for the
      prediction include the contribution due to reactions (from the last
      SDC iteration). This addition is done in
      ``construct_hydro_source()`` after the source terms are
      converted to primitive variables.

#. *Update radial data and center of mass for monopole gravity*

   This is the same as the Strang step \ `[strang:radial] <#strang:radial>`__

#. *Clean State* [``clean_state()``]

   This is the same as the Strang step \ `[strang:clean] <#strang:clean>`__

#. [strang:newsource] *Correct the source terms with the n+1 contribution*
   [``construct_new_gravity()``, ``do_new_sources`` ]

   This is the same as the Strang step \ `[strang:newsource] <#strang:newsource>`__

#. *Finalize* [``finalize_do_advance()``]

   This differs from Strang step \ `[strang:finalize] <#strang:finalize>`__ in that we do not
   construct :math:`d\Sb/dt`, but instead store the total hydrodynamical source
   term at the new time. As discussed above, this will be used in the
   next iteration to approximate the time-centered source term.

.. [1]
   Note: this functionality assumes that only the
   coarse grid touches the physical boundary. It does not use
   any use masks to prevent double counting if multiple levels
   touch the boundary.

.. [2]
   The correction for gravity is slightly different since we directly compute the time-centered gravitational source term using the hydrodynamic fluxes.
