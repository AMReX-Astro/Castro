abstract = {Astrophysical explosions such as supernovae are fascinating events that require sophisticated algorithms and substantial computational power to model. Castro and MAESTROeX are nuclear astrophysics codes that simulate thermonuclear fusion in the context of supernovae and X-ray bursts. Examining these nuclear burning processes using high resolution simulations is critical for understanding how these astrophysical explosions occur. In this paper we describe the changes that have been made to these codes to transform them from standard MPI + OpenMP codes targeted at petascale CPU-based systems into a form compatible with the pre-exascale systems now online and the exascale systems coming soon. We then discuss what new science is possible to run on systems such as Summit and Perlmutter that could not have been achieved on the previous generation of supercomputers.},

	abstract = {We continue to investigate two-dimensional laterally propagating flames in type I X-ray bursts using fully compressible hydrodynamics simulations. In the current study we relax previous approximations where we artificially boosted the flames. We now use more physically realistic reaction rates, thermal conductivities, and rotation rates, exploring the effects of neutron star rotation rate and thermal structure on the flame. We find that at lower rotation rates the flame becomes harder to ignite, whereas at higher rotation rates the nuclear burning is enhanced by increased confinement from the Coriolis force and the flame propagates steadily. At higher crustal temperatures, the flame moves more quickly and accelerates as it propagates through the atmosphere. If the temperature is too high, instead of a flame propagating across the surface the entire atmosphere burns uniformly. Our findings could have implications for the relationship between observed burst rise times and neutron star rotation and accretion rates. All of the software used for these simulations is freely available.},

	journal = {Research Notes of the {AAS}},
	abstract = {Many astrophysical environments involve convective or explosive flows driven by thermonuclear reactions (Type Ia supernovae, classical novae, X-ray bursts, stellar evolution). Simulation codes need to accurately capture the interactions between reactions and hydrodynamics to produce realistic models of these events. For astrophysical reacting flows, operator splitting is commonly used to couple hydrodynamics and reactions. Each process operates independent of one another, but by staggering the updates in a symmetric fashion (via Strang splitting) second order accuracy in time can be achieved. However, approximations are often made to the reacting system, including the choice of whether or not to integrate temperature with the species. Here we demonstrate through a simple convergence test that integrating an energy equation together with reactions achieves the best convergence when modeling reactive flows with Strang splitting. Additionally, second order convergence cannot be achieved without integrating an energy or temperature equation.},

abstract = {Through the use of axisymmetric 2D hydrodynamic simulations, we further investigate laterally propagating flames in X-ray bursts (XRBs). Our aim is to understand the sensitivity of a propagating helium flame to different nuclear physics. Using the Castro simulation code, we confirm the phenomenon of enhanced energy generation shortly after a flame is established by adding 12C(p, γ)13N(α, p)16O to the network, in agreement with the past literature. This sudden outburst of energy leads to a short accelerating phase, causing a drastic alteration in the overall dynamics of the flame in XRBs. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of different plasma screening routines on the propagation of the XRB flame. We finally examine the performance of simplified spectral deferred correction, a novel approach to hydrodynamics and reaction coupling incorporated in Castro, as an alternative to operator splitting.},

network, including the number of nuclei, choice of reaction rates, and approximations used. This is explored by modeling a simple detonation with the Castro simulation code. The entire simulation methodology is open-source and GPU-enabled.},

abstract = {X-ray bursts are the thermonuclear runaway of a mixed H/He layer on the surface of a neutron star. Observations suggest that the burning begi
ns locally and spreads across the surface of the star as a flame. Recent multidimensional work has looked in detail at pure He flames spreading across a 
neutron star. Here we report on progress in multidimensional modeling of mixed H/He flames and discuss the challenges.},

title = {Strong Coupling of Hydrodynamics and Reactions in Nuclear Statistical Equilibrium for Modeling Convection in Massive Stars},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {We build on the simplified spectral deferred corrections (SDC) coupling of hydrodynamics and reactions to handle the case of nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE) and electron/positron captures/decays in the cores of massive stars. Our approach blends a traditional reaction network on the grid with a tabulated NSE state from a very large,  nuclei network. We demonstrate how to achieve second-order accuracy in the simplified-SDC framework when coupling NSE to hydrodynamics, with the ability to evolve the star on the hydrodynamics time step. We discuss the application of this method to convection in massive stars leading up to core collapse. We also show how to initialize the initial convective state from a 1D model in a self-consistent fashion. All of these developments are done in the publicly available Castro simulation code and the entire simulation methodology is fully GPU-accelerated.},
