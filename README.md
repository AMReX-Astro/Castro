# Castro
*an adaptive mesh, astrophysical radiation hydrodynamics simulation code*

`Castro` is an adaptive-mesh compressible radiation hydrodynnamics
code for astrophysical flows.  `Castro` supports a general equation of
state, full Poisson gravity, reactive flows.


## Getting Started

To build `Castro`, you need a copy of the BoxLib library:

https://ccse.lbl.gov/BoxLib/index.html

(optionally) for Radiation, you'll want to get the
[CastroRadiation](https://github.com/BoxLib-Codes/CastroRadiation) source too.

There is a User's Guide in `Castro/UsersGuide/` (type `make` to build
from LaTeX source) that will guide you through running your first
problem.  A PDF of the User's Guide can be found at
