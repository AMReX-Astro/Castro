# PROBLEM PARAMETERS
problem.diff_coeff = 1.0

# To test the theta-dependence of the spherical 2D diffusion solver, either
# 1. Set a nonzero problem center for Gaussian initial condition via problem.center
#    This requires resolution convergence test
# 2. Initialize problem with theta-dependent initial condition via gaussian_init=0.
#    There is an analytic solution for this.

# This input file is used to test option 1.
# This is meant to change the position of the Gaussian peak.
# We use outflow condition in r-dir
# and make sure the Gaussian diffuses quickly before reaching the boundary.
# Note that changing problem::center only works with gaussian initial condition,
# i.e. problem.gaussian_init=1
