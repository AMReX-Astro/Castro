The Verification directory contains the analytic solutions for the
Sedov problem, as computed using Frank Timmes' exact Sedov routine,
http://www.cococubed.com/codes/sedov/sedov3.f

To compare Castro output, we need to radially bin the plotfile data to
get density, total velocity, and pressure as a function of radius.
This can be accomplished using fsedov*.f90 routines in
Castro/Diagnostics/Sedov

For the 2-d Cylindrical explosion in Cartesian coordinates, run

   ./Castro2d.Linux.Intel.Intel.ex inputs.2d.cyl_in_cartcoords

   Creating the angle-averaged profile:

   compile fParallel/data_processing/fsedov2d_cyl_in_cartcoords.f90

   ./fsedov2d_cyl_in_cartcoords.Linux.Intel.exe -p ../plt00144 -s sedov2d.out

A Gnuplot script to plot the data overtop the analytic solution is
provided, simply execute

   gnuplot sedov2d.gp

in the Sedov/Verification/ directory (where the above slices should have been
output).

When running inputs.2d.sph_in_cylcoords or inputs.3d.sph, use sedov.gp instead
of sedov2d.gp

NOTES:

-- to get good agreement with the analytic solution for the Sedov problem,
   it is necessary to start off with a small timestep.  This is
   accomplished by setting castro.init_shrink = 0.1 in the inputs file.

-- Subsampling is critical to ensure that the perturbation is as spherical
   as possible.  

-- It is important to use a lot of 'steps' in the sedov3.f routine to get
   a good analytic solution.
