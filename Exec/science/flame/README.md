# Problem Description

This is a simple 1-d flame problem.  It sets up a fuel and ash region
with a smooth transition in temperature and composition.  The density
is computed such that the domain is at constant pressure initially.
Thermal diffusion heats the fuel to the point of ignition and a flame
ignites and propagates to the right.
