Scaling tests on Frontier.  These use the same setup as done with Summit.
We can build as:

```
make USE_HIP=TRUE DIM=3 -j 6 TINY_PROFILE=TRUE NETWORK_DIR=iso7
```

Note: between ROCm 5.3 and ROCm 6, we changed Microphysics to no
longer inline everything automatically, since HIP generates bad code
when we do (it has trouble with large kernels).  This may be responsible
for some of the slowdown observed from the 2003 numbers to the 2004 numbers.
