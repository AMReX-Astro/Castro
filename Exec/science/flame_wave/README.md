# flame_wave

This is the XRB flame setup, which was used in Eiden et al. 2020
(https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...894....6E).  That
original paper used "boosted" flames, but we no longer boost the flame
speed.  You can find the inputs file for boosted flame in Castro
versions 21.01 and earlier.

The current set of inputs files are:

* inputs_He:

  pure He flames.  This includes the inputs files for the follow-on
  paper, Harpole et al. (in prep).

  a 3-d setup is also there

* inputs_H_He:

  mixed H/He flames.  These are intended to be run with the rprox
  network.
