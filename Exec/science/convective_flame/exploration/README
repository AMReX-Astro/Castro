You will need to compile the convective flame problem code in its original directory and copy the files necessary for it to run into this exploration directory.

STEPS:

1. Modify the variables you want to test as you see fit in setup_explore.py
2. Run setup_explore.py
3. The problem code and model files it needs to run need to be copied into the new directories made by setup_explore.py
4. Run the problem code in each of the new directories
5. Run process.py to generate .png images and write html
6. Optional: You can use flamefront.py to generate a plot of a 1D slice of the plotfiles in a directory, plotted over time.
