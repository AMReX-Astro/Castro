  ! Following Pakmor et al. 2013, set up the primary
  ! with 1.1 solar masses and the secondary with 0.9.
  ! We need to override the C/O WD limit to allow a
  ! larger C/O WD, and we need to add the helium shell.
  ! This implementation is more rudimentary than the
  ! Pakmor et al. implementation because we will make
  ! the entire outer envelope of the WD pure helium,
  ! but with no phased transition layer into the C/O
  ! core. This is not intended to be especially realistic;
  ! the focus is on understanding what resolution is
  ! needed for simulating this type of event.
