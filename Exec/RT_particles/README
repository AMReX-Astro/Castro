This problem takes the Rayleigh-Taylor problem from the Castro/Exec/RT
directory and adds particles.  These particles are moved with a random
walk each time step, and if they leave the domain then they just
"disappear."  

This test is primarily designed to test the ability of Castro to handle 
particles.
