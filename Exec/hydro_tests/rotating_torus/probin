  ! The polytrope constant is selected so that the maximum density is one,
  ! given our choices for the torus, the point mass, and gamma. If you change
  ! them in the setup or the inputs file, you must redo this calculation. We
  ! compute it statically here so that the C++ and Fortran EOS agree.
