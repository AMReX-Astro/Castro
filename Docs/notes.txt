Amr class is what drives the whole simulation -- this is the highest level

AmrLevel is a C++ object that has the whole fluid state

Castro is an AmrLevel class for a single level -- contains all the data needed to advance the state for a single level

Multifab is a class that contains the data on an AMR level -- this is the main datastructure in the AmrLevel 


e.g. look at Amr::CoarseTimestep() in the AMR class -- driver for the 
 main level

  -- this will also drive the finer grids, including subcycling



Each AMR level is a Castro object

   Castro has StateData -- these are basically MultiFabs

   StateType = fluids
   PhiGrav_Type = gravitational potential, etc.


   These all are on the same domain / gridding, and have different number
   of components.

   The reason for having them separate StateData (these are essentially
   different offsets into the MF)

   StateData has a new time and old time MF

   The different types of data have different logistics (number of
   ghost cells, boundary condition fills, etc.)



level advance is calling Castro::advance()

   advance_hydro() is where most of the action is

      initializes data at the old time (e.g. call the gravity solve at
      the old time)

      calculate the source terms at the old time

      does reactions

      does hydro 


A multifab covers the entire domain.  This is a collection of Fortran
Array Boxes.

    Each processor owns different FABs.

    To do work, we loop over the boxes local on the processor (this is 
    done via the MFIter)

Different data can have different numbers of ghost cells.  To do the
hydrodynamics, we need to have ghost cells.  Ghost cells are instantiated
as needed (by creating a new FAB using the FillPatch)

   Sborder has ghost zone (NUM_GROW = 4)

   FillPatch -- you give it the State_Type, the time-level, components
      -- this is where all the communication is done.


All the numerics is done in Fortran kernels.  You had to Fortran a FAB
and Fortran will do the updating.  No parallel communication is done
in Fortran -- it is all local.  You don't need to know about neighbors, etc.

   Note that the interger indices refer to the global index space AT THAT
   LEVEL

   In Fortran, we will always use subroutines, not functions
