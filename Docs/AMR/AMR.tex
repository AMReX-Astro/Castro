Our approach to adaptive refinement in \castro\ uses a nested hierarchy
of logically-rectangular grids with simultaneous refinement of the
grids in both space and time.  The integration algorithm on the grid
hierarchy is a recursive procedure in which coarse grids are advanced
in time, fine grids are advanced multiple steps to reach the same time
as the coarse grids and the data at different levels are then
synchronized.

During the regridding step, increasingly finer grids
are recursively embedded in coarse grids until the solution is
sufficiently resolved.  An error estimation procedure based on
user-specified criteria (described in Section \ref{sec:tagging}) 
evaluates where additional refinement is needed
and grid generation procedures dynamically create or
remove rectangular fine grid patches as resolution requirements change.

A good introduction to the style of AMR used here is in Lecture 1
of the Adaptive Mesh Refinement Short Course at

\section{Tagging for Refinement}
\label{sec:tagging}

\castro\ determines what zones should be tagged for refinement at the
next regridding step by using a set of built-in routines that test on
quantities such as the density and pressure and determining whether
the quantities themselves or their gradients pass a user-specified
threshold.  This may then be extended if {\tt amr.n\_error\_buf} $> 0$
to a certain number of zones beyond these tagged zones. This section
describes the process by which zones are tagged, and describes how to
add customized tagging criteria.

The routines for tagging cells are located in the {\tt Tagging\_nd.f90} file 
in the {\tt Src\_nd} directory. (These are dimension-agnostic routines that loop 
over all three dimensional indices even for 1D or 2D problems.) The main routines are 
{\tt ca\_denerror}, {\tt ca\_temperror}, {\tt ca\_presserror}, {\tt ca\_velerror}, 
and {\tt ca\_raderror}. They refine based on density, temperature, pressure, 
velocity, and radiation (if enabled), respectively. The same approach is used 
for all of them. As an example, we consider the density tagging routine. There 
are four parameters that control tagging. If the density in a zone is greater than 
the user-specified parameter {\tt denerr}, then that zone will be tagged 
for refinement, but only if the current AMR level is less than the 
user-specified parameter {\tt max\_denerr\_lev}. Similarly, 
if the absolute density gradient between a zone and any adjacent zone 
is greater than the user-specified parameter {\tt dengrad}, that zone 
will be tagged for refinement, but only if we are currently on a level 
below {\tt max\_dengrad\_lev}. Note that setting {\tt denerr} alone will 
not do anything; you'll need to set {\tt max\_dengrad\_lev} $>= 1$ for
this to have any effect.

All four of these parameters are set in the {\tt \&tagging} namelist 
in your {\tt probin} file. If left unmodified, they default to a value 
that means we will never tag. The complete set of parameters that can 
be controlled this way is the following:
\begin{multicols}{5}
\begin{itemize}
  \setlength{\itemindent}{-3em}
  \item {\tt denerr}
  \item {\tt max\_denerr\_lev}
  \item {\tt dengrad}
  \item {\tt max\_dengrad\_lev}
  \item {\tt temperr}
  \item {\tt max\_temperr\_lev}
  \item {\tt tempgrad}
  \item {\tt max\_tempgrad\_lev}
  \item {\tt velerr}
  \item {\tt max\_velerr\_lev}
  \item {\tt velgrad}
  \item {\tt max\_velgrad\_lev}
  \item {\tt presserr}
  \item {\tt max\_presserr\_lev}
  \item {\tt pressgrad}
  \item {\tt max\_pressgrad\_lev}
  \item {\tt raderr}
  \item {\tt max\_raderr\_lev}
  \item {\tt radgrad}
  \item {\tt max\_radgrad\_lev}
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}
Since there are multiple algorithms for determining 
whether a zone is tagged or not, it is worthwhile to specify 
in detail what is happening to a zone in the code during this step. 
We show this in the following pseudocode section. A zone 
is tagged if the variable {\tt itag = SET}, and is not tagged 
if {\tt itag = CLEAR} (these are mapped to 1 and 0, respectively).

\begin{verbatim}
itag = CLEAR

for errfunc[k] from k = 1 ... N
    // Three possibilities for itag: SET or CLEAR or remaining unchanged
    call errfunc[k](itag)  
end for
\end{verbatim}

In particular, notice that there is an order dependence of this operation; if {\tt errfunc[2]} 
{\tt CLEAR}s a zone and then {\tt errfunc[3]} {\tt SET}s that zone, the final operation will 
be to tag that zone (and vice versa). In practice by default this does not matter, because the 
built-in tagging routines never explicitly perform a \texttt{CLEAR}. However, 
it is possible to overwrite the {\tt Tagging\_nd.f90} file if you want to change how 
{\tt ca\_denerror, ca\_temperror}, etc. operate. This is not recommended, and if you do so
be aware that {\tt CLEAR}ing a zone this way may not have the desired effect.

We provide also the ability for the user to define their own tagging criteria.
This is done through the Fortran function {\tt set\_problem\_tags} in the 
{\tt problem\_tagging\_*d.f90} files. This function is provided the entire 
state (including density, temperature, velocity, etc.) and the array 
of tagging status for every zone. As an example of how to use this, suppose we 
have a 3D Cartesian simulation where we want to tag any zone that has a 
density gradient greater than 10, but we don't care about any regions 
outside a radius $r > 75$ from the problem origin; we leave them always unrefined. 
We also want to ensure that the region $r \leq 10$ is always refined.
In our {\tt probin} file we would set {\tt denerr = 10} and {\tt max\_denerr\_lev = 1}
in the {\tt \&tagging} namelist. We would also make a copy of 
{\tt problem\_tagging\_3d.f90} to our work directory and set it up as follows:

\section{Synchronization Algorithm}

Here is the AMR algorithm for the compressible equations with
self-gravity.  The gravity component of the algorithm is closely
related to (but not identical to) that in Miniati and Colella, JCP,
2007 (in press).

Over a coarse grid time step we collect flux register information for
the hyperbolic part of the synchronization:
\begin{equation}
\delta\Fb = -\Delta t_c A^c F^c + \sum \Delta t_f A^f F^f
\end{equation}
Analogously, at the end of a coarse grid time step we store the
mismatch in normal gradients of $\phi$ at the coarse-fine interface:
\begin{equation}
\delta F_\phi =  - A^c \frac{\partial \phi^c}{\partial n}
+ \sum A^f \frac{\partial \phi^f}{\partial n}
\end{equation}
Because we want the composite $\phi^{c-f}$ to satisfy the multilevel
version of (\ref{eq:Self Gravity}) at each time $t^n$, we do not
accumulate $\frac{\partial \phi^f}{\partial n}$ over time, rather we
add coarse and fine fluxes only at integer coarse times.

At the end of a coarse grid time step we can define
${\overline{\Ub}}^{c-f}$ and $\overline{\phi}^{c-f}$ as the composite
of the data from coarse and fine grids as a provisional solution at
time $n+1$. (Assume $\overline{\Ub}$ has been averaged down so that
the data on coarse cells underlying fine cells is the average of the
fine cell data above it.)

The synchronization consists of two parts: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Step 1:  Hyperbolic reflux

In the hyperbolic reflux step, we update the conserved variables with
the flux synchronization and adjust the gravitational terms to reflect
the changes in $\rho$ and $\ub$.
\begin{equation}
{\Ub}^{c, \star} = \overline{\Ub}^{c} + \frac{\delta\Fb}{V},
\end{equation}
where $V$ is the volume of the cell and the correction from
$\delta\Fb$ is supported only on coarse cells adjacent to fine grids.

Note: this can be enabled/disabled via {\tt castro.do\_reflux}.  Generally,
it should be enabled ({\tt 1}).

Also note that for axisymmetric or 1D spherical coordinates, the 
reflux of the pressure gradient is different, since it cannot be
expressed as a divergence in those geometries.  We use a separate
flux register in the hydro code to store the pressure term in these
cases.  

\item Step 2:  Gravitational synchronization

In this step we correct for the mismatch in normal derivative in
$\phi^{c-f}$ at the coarse-fine interface, as well as accounting for
the changes in source terms for $(\rho \ub)$ and $(\rho E)$ due to the
change in $\rho.$

On the coarse grid only, we define
\begin{equation}
(\delta \rho)^{c} =  \rho^{c, \star} - {\overline{\rho}}^{c}  .
\end{equation}

We then form the composite residual, which is composed of two
contributions.  The first is the degree to which the current $
\overline{\phi}^{c-f}$ does not satisfy the original equation on a
composite grid (since we have solved for $\overline{\phi}^{c-f}$
separately on the coarse and fine levels).  The second is the response
of $\phi$ to the change in $\rho.$ We define
\begin{equation} R \equiv  4 \pi G \rho^{\star,c-f} - \Delta^{c-f} \; \overline{\phi}^{c-f} 
= - 4 \pi G (\delta \rho)^c - (\nabla \cdot \delta F_\phi ) |_c   .
\end{equation}

Then we solve
\begin{equation}
 \Delta^{c-f} \; \delta \phi^{c-f} = R
\label{eq:gravsync}
\end{equation}
as a two level solve at the coarse and fine levels.  
We define the update to gravity,
\begin{equation}
\delta {\bf g}^{c-f} = \nabla (\delta \phi^{c-f})  .
\end{equation}

Define the \sync sources for momentum on the coarse and fine, $S^{\sync,c}_{\rho \ub}$, and
$S^{\sync,f}_{\rho \ub}$, respectively as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
S^{\sync,c}_{\rho \ub} &=& \left(
        \overline{\rho}^c + (\delta \rho)^c \right) ({\bf g}^{c,n+1} + \delta {\bf g}^{c-f}) -
        \overline{\rho}^c                 \; {\bf g}^{c,n+1} \nonumber \\
           &=& \left[( \delta \rho)^c {\bf g}^{c,n+1} + 
                \rho^{c,\star} \delta {\bf g}^c)  \right ] \\
S^{\sync,f}_{\rho \ub} &=& \overline{\rho}^{f} \; \delta {\bf g}^f  .
\end{eqnarray}
These momentum sources lead to the following energy sources:
\begin{eqnarray}
S^{\sync,c}_{\rho E} &=& S^{\sync,c}_{\rho \ub} \cdot
         \left(   \overline{\ub}^{c,n+1} + S^{\sync,c}_{\rho \ub} \Delta t_c / (2 \overline{\rho}^{c,n+1}) \right) \\
S^{\sync,f}_{\rho E} &=& S^{\sync,f}_{\rho \ub} \cdot
         \left(
    \overline{\ub}^{f} + S^{\sync,f}_{\rho \ub} \Delta t_f / (2 \; \overline{\rho}^{f} )
         \right)
\end{eqnarray}

The coarse and fine level state is updated using:
\begin{eqnarray}
(\rho \ub)^{c,n+1} =  (\rho \ub)^{c, \star } + \myhalf \Delta t_c S^{\sync,c}_{\rho \ub} ,&&
(\rho \ub)^{f,n+1} =  (\overline{\rho \ub})^{f} + \myhalf \Delta t_f S^{\sync,f}_{\rho \ub},  \\
(\rho E)^{c,n+1} =  (\rho E)^{c, \star } + \myhalf \Delta t_c S^{\sync,c}_{\rho E} ,&&
(\rho E)^{f,n+1} =  (\overline{\rho E})^{f} + \myhalf \Delta t_f S^{\sync,f}_{\rho E}  .
\end{eqnarray}
As the final component of this step we need to 
\begin{itemize}
\item add $\delta \phi^{c-f}$ directly to 
to $\phi^{c}$ and $\phi^{f}$ and interpolate $\delta \phi^{c-f}$ to any finer
levels and add to the current $\phi$ at those levels.

\item if level $c$ is not the coarsest level in the calculation, then we must transmit the
effect of this change in $\phi$ to the coarser levels by updating the flux register between
level $c$ and the next coarser level, $cc.$ In particular, we set
\begin{equation}
\delta {F_\phi}^{cc-c} = \delta F_\phi^{cc-c} 
+ \sum A^c \frac{\partial (\delta \phi)^{c-f}}{\partial n}  .
\end{equation}
\end{itemize}

The gravity synchronization algorithm can be disabled with {\tt
  gravity.no\_sync = 1}.  This should be done with care.  Generally,
it is okay only if he refluxing happens in regions of low density that
don't affect the gravity substantially.

\end{itemize}
