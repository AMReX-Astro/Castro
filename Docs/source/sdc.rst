The Castro SDC solver couples the hydrodynamics tightly together,
iteratively improving the convergence of the solution.  This is the
basis of the 4th order accurate Castro solver.

.. note::

   Here we are referring to the full SDC time integration scheme
   (``castro.time_integration_method = 2``), not the simplified-SDC solver.


The options that describe the quadrature and iterations are:

* ``castro.sdc_order`` : the desired spatial and temporal order.  2 and 4 are supported.

* ``castro.sdc_quadrature`` : the quadrature scheme used for the
  time-integration.  This determines the number and location of the
  temporal nodes.  Supported values are 0 for Gauss-Lobatto and 1 for
  Radau IIA.

* ``castro.sdc_extra`` : the number of extra iterations to take.  By
  default the number of iterations used is equal to the value of
  ``sdc_order``.


The options that affect the nonlinear solve are:

* ``sdc_solver`` : the method we use to do the nonlinear solution of
  the reaction system.  Values are:

  * 1 : pure Newton iteration (we subdivide the time interval if
    needed to get the Newton method to converge).

  * 2 : use VODE to solve the nonlinear system by expressing it as an ODE system.

  * 3 : use VODE for the first iteration and then Newton for the
    subsequent iterations.

* ``sdc_solver_tol_dens`` : the relative error on the density in solving the nonlinear system.

* ``sdc_solver_tol_spec`` : the relative error on the partial densities, :math:`(\rho X_k)`
  in the nonlinear solve.

* ``sdc_solver_tol_ener`` : the relative error of the energy in the nonlinear solve.

* ``sdc_solver_atol`` : the absolute error in the mass fractions during the nonlinear solve.

* ``sdc_solver_relax_factor`` : the factor by which to relax the
  tolerances (i.e. increase them) for earlier iterations.  We reach
  the desired tolerances on the final iteration.

* ``sdc_solve_for_rhoe`` : whether we solve the system in terms of :math:`(\rho e)` or :math:`(\rho E)`.

* ``sdc_use_analytic_jac`` : whether we use the analytic Jacobian for
  the reaction part of the system or compute it numerically.
