Introduction to Castro
**********************

Castro is a adaptive mesh, radiation/MHD hydrodynamics code that is
designed to model astrophysical reacting flows on massively parallel
computers.

Castro's major capabilities:

  * 1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional unsplit, 2nd-order finite-volume
    hydrodynamics; 4th order hydro for uniform grids.
    (see :ref:`ch:hydro`)

  * 3-dimension constrained transport ideal MHD (single level only currently)
    (see :ref:`ch:mhd`)

  * multigroup flux-limited diffusion radiation hydrodynamics
    (see :ref:`ch:radiation`)

  * generalized retry mechanism for recovering from physical
    violations over a timestep (see :ref:`ch:retry`)

  * adaptive mesh refinement with subcycling; jumps of 2x and 4x
    between levels (see :ref:`ch:amr`)

  * arbitrary equation of state (provided by the companion StarKiller
    Microphysics project)

  * general nuclear reaction networks

  * explicit thermal diffusion (see :ref:`ch:diffusion`)

  * full Poisson gravity (with isolated boundary conditions)
    and a conservative energy formulation (see :ref:`ch:gravity`)

  * rotation (in the co-rotating frame) in 2-d axisymmetric and 3-d
    (see :ref:`ch:rotation`)

  * spectral deferred corrections time integration for coupling hydro
    and reactions (see :ref:`ch:sdc`)

  * parallelization via MPI + OpenMP or MPI + CUDA


Development Model
=================

Castro is developed on github (https://github.com/amrex-astro/Castro
). The ``main`` branch is stable and can be used for day-to-day
science.  New changes are made via pull requests to the
``development`` branch.  This is where the ongoing regression testing
is done (both on CPU and GPU).

At the start of each month, we merge ``development`` → ``main`` and
apply a tag of the form ``YY.MM`` (e.g. ``20.02`` for Feb. 2020).  We
also create a github release and mint a Zenodo DOI using the
information in the ``.zenodo.json`` file at the root level.

Castro "core developers" are those who have made substantial code
contributions (details are in the main ``README.md``).  These
developers are coauthors on the Zenodo DOI and of any papers
describing Castro generally (science papers coauthors are decided by
the science paper lead).


Units and Conventions
=====================

Castro works in CGS units unless otherwise specified.
:numref:`table:units` shows some of the common symbols / names used
throughout the code documentation and papers.
