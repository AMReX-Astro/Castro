Code structure
==============

Castro is built upon the AMReX C++ framework. This provides
high-level classes for managing an adaptive mesh refinement
simulation, including the core data structures we will deal with. A
key design pattern in AMReX is that the overall memory management
and parallelization is done in the C++ layer, while the heavy
computational work is done in Fortran kernels. AMReX provides
convenient data structures that allow for this workflow—high level
objects in C++ that communicate with Fortran through pointers to
data regions that appear as multidimensional arrays.

Castro uses a structured-grid approach to hydrodynamics. We work
with square/cubic zones that hold state variables (density, momentum,
etc.) and compute the fluxes of these quantities through the
interfaces of the zones (this is a finite-volume approach).
Parallelization is achieved by domain decomposition. We divide our
domain into many smaller boxes, and distributed these across
processors. When information is needed at the boundaries of the
boxes, messages are exchanged and this data is held in a perimeter of
*ghost cells*. AMReX manages this decompostion and
communication for us. Additionally, AMReX implements adaptive mesh
refinement. In addition to the coarse decomposition of our domain
into zones and boxes, we can refine rectangular regions by adding
finer-gridded boxes on top of the coarser grid. We call the
collection of boxes at the same resolution a *level*.

Castro uses a hybrid MPI + OpenMP approach to parallelism. MPI is
at used to communicate across nodes on a computer and OpenMP is used
within a node, to loop over subregions of a box with different
threads.

The code structure in the Castro/ directory reflects the
division between C++ and Fortran.

Major data structures
=====================

The following data structures are the most commonly encountered when
working in the C++ portions of Castro. This are all
AMReX data-structures / classes.

``Amr``
-------

This is the main class that drives the whole simulation. This is
the highest level in Castro.

``AmrLevel`` and Castro classes
-------------------------------

An ``AmrLevel`` is a virtual base class provided by AMReX that
stores all the state data on a single level in the AMR hierarchy and
understands how to advance that data in time.

The most important data managed by the ``AmrLevel`` is an array of
``StateData``, which holds the fluid quantities, etc., in the boxes
that together make up the level.

The ``Castro`` class is derived from the ``AmrLevel``. It provides
the Castro-specific routines to evolve our system of equations. Like
the ``AmrLevel``, there is one ``Castro`` object for each level in the
AMR hierarchry.

A lot of the member data in the ``Castro`` class are static member
variables—this means that they are shared across all instances of
the class. So, in this case, every level will have the same data.
This is done, in particular, for the values of the runtime parameters,
but also for the ``Gravity``, ``Diffusion``, and ``Radiation``
objects. This means that those objects cover all levels and are the
same object in each instantiation of the ``Castro`` class.

Floating point data
-------------------

Floating point data in the C++ AMReX framework is declared as
``Real``. This is typedef to either ``float`` or ``double`` depending
on the make variable ``PRECISION``.

The corresponding type for Fortran is provided by the
``amrex_fort_module`` as ``c_real``. We typically rename
this to rt when using it. An example of a declaration of a
parameter is::

      use amrex_fort_module, only : rt => amrex_real
      real(rt) :: tol = 1.0e-10_rt

The ``amrex_constants_module`` provides common constants that can
be used in the code, like ``ZERO``, ``THIRD``, ``ONE``, etc.

.. note :: single precision support in Castro is not yet complete. In
   particular, a lot of the supporting microphysics has not been updated.

``Box`` and ``FArrayBox``
-------------------------

A ``Box`` is simply a rectangular region in space. It does not hold
data. In AMReX, an AMR level has a global index space, with
:math:`(0,0,0)` being the lower left corner of the domain at that level, and
:math:`(N_x-1, N_y-1, N_z-1)` being the upper right corner of the domain
(for a domain of :math:`N_x \times N_y \times N_z` zones). The location of
any ``Box`` at a level can be uniquely specified with respect to this
global index space by giving the index of its lower-left and
upper-right corners. :numref:`fig:soft:indexspace` shows an
example of three boxes at the same level of refinement.

AMReX provides other data structures that collect Boxes together,
most importantly the ``BoxArray``. We generally do not use these
directly, with the exception of the ``BoxArray`` ``grids``,
which is defined as part of the ``AmrLevel`` class that ``Castro``
inherits. ``grids`` is used when building new ``MultiFabs`` to give
the layout of the boxes at the current level.

.. _fig:soft:indexspace:
.. figure:: index_grid2.png
   :width: 4in

   Three boxes that comprise a single level. At this
   resolution, the domain is 20 :math:`\times` 18 zones. Note that the
   indexing in AMReX starts with :math:`0`.

A ``FArrayBox`` or *FAB*, for *Fortran array box* is a data
structure that contains a ``Box`` locating it in space, as well as a
pointer to a data buffer. The real floating point data are stored as
one-dimensional arrays in ``FArrayBox`` es. The associated ``Box`` can be
used to reshape the 1D array into multi-dimensional arrays to be used
by Fortran subroutines. The key part of the C++ AMReX data
structures is that this data buffer can be sent to Fortran, where it
will appear as a DIM+1 dimensional array (DIM space + 1
component).

.. note:: Castro is complied for a specific dimensionality.

``MultiFab``
------------

At the highest abstraction level, we have the ``MultiFab`` (mulitple
FArrayBoxes). A ``MultiFab`` contains an array of ``Box`` es, including
boxes owned by other processors for the purpose of communication,
an array of MPI ranks specifying which MPI processor owns each ``Box``,
and an array of pointers to ``FArrayBoxes`` owned by this MPI
processor. 

.. note:: a ``MultiFab`` is a collection of the boxes that together
   make up a single level of data in the AMR hierarchy.

A ``MultiFab`` can have multiple components (like density, temperature,
...) as well as a perimeter of ghost cells to exchange data with
neighbors or implement boundary conditions (this is all reflected in
the underlying ``FArrayBox``).

Parallelization in AMReX is done by distributing the FABs across
processors. Each processor knows which FABs are local to it. To loop
over all the boxes local to a processor, an ``MFIter`` is used (more
on this below).

High-level operations exist on ``MultiFab`` s to add, subtract, multiply,
etc., them together or with scalars, so you don’t need to write out
loops over the data directly.

In Castro, ``MultiFab`` s are one of the main data structures you will
interact with in the C++ portions of the code.

.. _soft:sec:statedata:

``StateData``
-------------

``StateData`` is a class that essentially holds a pair of
``MultiFab`` s: one at the old time and one at the new
time. AMReX knows how to interpolate in time between these states to
get data at any intermediate point in time. The main data that we care
about in Castro (the fluid state, gravitational potential, etc.) will
be stored as ``StateData``. Essentially, data is made StateData in
Castro if we need it to be stored in checkpoints / plotfiles, and/or
we want it to be automatically interpolated when we refine.

An ``AmrLevel`` stores an array of ``StateData`` (in a C++ array
called ``state``). We index this array using integer keys (defined
via an enum in ``Castro.H``). The state data is registered
with AMReX in ``Castro_setup.cpp``.

Note that each of the different ``StateData`` carried in the state
array can have different numbers of components, ghost cells, boundary
conditions, etc. This is the main reason we separate all this data
into separate StateData objects collected together in an indexable
array.

The current ``StateData`` names Castro carries are:

-  ``State_Type`` : this is the ``NUM_STATE`` hydrodynamics
   components that make up the conserved hydrodynamics state (usually
   referred to as :math:`\Ub` in these notes. But note that this does
   not include the radiation energy density.

   In Fortran, the components of a FAB derived from ``State_Type``
   is indexed using the integer keys defined in ``Castro_nd.F90``
   and stored in ``meth_params_module``, e.g., ``URHO``, ``UMX``,
   ``UMY``, ...

   .. note:: regardless of dimensionality, we always carry around all
      three velocity components. The “out-of-plane” components will
      simply be advected, but we will allow rotation (in particular,
      the Coriolis force) to affect them.

   ``State_Type`` ``MultiFab`` s have no ghost cells by default for
   pure hydro and a single ghost cell by default when ``RADIATION``
   is enabled. There is an option to force them to have ghost cells by
   setting the parameter ``castro.state_nghost`` at runtime.

   Note that the prediction of the hydrodynamic state to the interface
   will require 4 ghost cells. This accomodated by creating a separate
   MultiFab, ``Sborder`` that lives at the old-time level and
   has the necessary ghost cells. We will describe this more later.

-  ``Rad_Type`` : this stores the radiation energy density,
   commonly denoted :math:`E_r` in these notes. It has ``nGroups``
   components—the number of energy groups used in the multigroup
   radiation hydrodynamics approximation.

-  ``PhiGrav_Type`` : this is simply the gravitational
   potential, usually denoted :math:`\Phi` in these notes.

-  ``Gravity_Type`` : this is the gravitational
   acceleration. There are always 3 components, regardless of the
   dimensionality (consistent with our choice of always carrying all 3
   velocity components).

-  ``PhiRot_Type`` : this is the rotational potential.
   When rotation is enabled, this will store the effective potential
   corresponding to the centrifugal force.

-  ``Source_Type`` : this holds the time-rate of change of
   the source terms, :math:`d\Sb/dt`, for each of the ``NUM_STATE``
   ``State_Type`` variables.


   .. note:: we do not make use of the old-time quantity here. In
      fact, we never allocate the ``FArrayBox`` s for the old-time in
      the ``Source_Type`` ``StateData``, so there is not wasted
      memory.

-  ``Reactions_Type`` : this holds the data for the nuclear
   reactions. It has ``NumSpec+2`` components: the species
   creation rates (usually denoted :math:`\omegadot_k` in these notes),
   the specific energy generation rate (:math:`\dot{e}_\mathrm{nuc}`),
   and its density (:math:`\rho \dot{e}_\mathrm{nuc}`).

   These are stored as ``StateData`` so we have access to the reaction terms
   outside of advance, both for diagnostics (like flame speed estimation)
   and for reaction timestep limiting (this in particular needs the
   data stored in checkpoints for continuity of timestepping upon restart).

- ``Mag_Type_x`` : this is defined for MHD and stores the
   face-centered (on x-faces) x-component of the magnetic field.

- ``Mag_Type_y`` : this is defined for MHD and stores the
   face-centered (on y-faces) y-component of the magnetic field.

- ``Mag_Type_z`` : this is defined for MHD and stores the
   face-centered (on z-faces) z-component of the magnetic field.

-  ``Simplified_SDC_React_Type`` : this is used with the SDC
   time-advancement algorithm. This stores the ``NQSRC`` terms
   that describe how the primitive variables change over the timestep
   due only to reactions. These are used when predicting the interface
   states of the primitive variables for the hydrodynamics portion of the
   algorithm.

We access the ``MultiFab`` s that carry the data of interest by interacting
with the ``StateData`` using one of these keys. For instance::

    MultiFab& S_new = get_new_data(State_Type);

gets a pointer to the ``MultiFab`` containing the hydrodynamics state data
at the new time.

Various source ``MultiFabs``
----------------------------

There are a number of different ``MultiFabs`` (and arrays of ``MultiFabs``)
that hold source term information.

-  ``hydro_source`` : this is a ``MultiFab`` that holds the
   update to the hydrodynamics (basically the divergence of the
   fluxes). This is filled in the conservative update routine of the
   hydrodynamics.

   As this is expressed as a source term, what is actually stored is

   .. math:: \Sb_\mathrm{flux} = -\nabla \cdot {\bf F}

   So the update of the conserved state appears as:

   .. math:: \frac{\partial \Ub}{\partial t} = \Sb_\mathrm{flux}

-  ``sources_for_hydro`` : a single ``MultiFab`` that stores
   the sum of sources over each physical process.

``MFIter`` and interacting with Fortran
=======================================

The process of looping over boxes at a given level of refinement and
operating on their data in Fortran is linked to how Castro achieves
thread-level parallelism. The OpenMP approach in Castro has evolved
considerably since the original paper was written, with the modern
approach, called *tiling*, gearing up to meet the demands of
many-core processors in the next-generation of supercomputers. We
discuss the original and new approach together here.

In both cases, the key construct is the ``MFiter``—this is a
C++ iterator that knows how to loop over the ``FArrayBox`` es in the
``MultiFab`` that are local to the processor (in this way, a lot of the
parallelism is hidden from view).

.. _sec:amrex0:

Non-Tiling MFIter
-----------------

The non-tiling way to iterate over the ``FArrayBox`` s is [1]_:

.. code:: c++

      for (MFIter mfi(mf); mfi.isValid(); ++mfi) // Loop over boxes
      {
        // Get the index space of this iteration
        const Box& box = mfi.validbox();

        // Get a reference to the FAB, which contains data and box
        FArrayBox& fab = mf[mfi];

        // Get the index space for the data region in th FAB.
        // Note "abox" may have ghost cells, and is thus larger than
        // or equal to "box" obtained using mfi.validbox().
        const Box& abox = fab.box();

        // We can now pass the information to a Fortran routine,
        // fab.dataPtr() gives a double*, which is reshaped into
        // a multi-dimensional array with dimensions specified by
        // the information in "abox". We will also pass "box",
        // which specifies our "work" region.
        do_work(ARLIM_3D(box.loVect()), ARLIM_3D(box.hiVect()),
                fab.dataPtr(), fab.nComp(),
                ARLIM_3D(abox.loVect()), ARLIM_3D(abox.hiVect())

      }

A few comments about this code

-  In this example, we are working off of a ``MultiFab`` named ``mf``.
   This could, for example, come from state data as::

        MultiFab& mf = get_old_data(State_Type);

-  We are passing the data in ``mf`` one box at a time to the
   Fortran function ``do_work``.

-  Here the ``MFIter`` iterator, ``mfi``, will perform the loop
   only over the boxes that are local to the MPI task. If there are 3
   boxes on the processor, then this loop has 3 iterations.

   ``++mfi`` iterates to the next ``FArrayBox`` owned by the
   ``MultiFab`` ``mf``, and ``mfi.isValid()`` returns false
   after we’ve reached the last box contained in the ``MultiFab``,
   terminating the loop.

-  ``box`` as returned from ``mfi.validbox()`` does not include
   ghost cells. This is the valid data region only.
   We can get the indices of the valid zones as ``box.loVect()`` and
   ``box.hiVect()``.

   In passing to the Fortran function, we use the macro
   ``ARLIM_3D``, defined in ``ArrayLim.H`` to pass the ``lo``
   and ``hi`` vectors as pointers to an ``int`` array. This array
   is defined to always be 3D, with 0s substituted for the
   higher dimension values if we are running in 1- or 2D.

   Passing the data in this 3D fashion is a newer approach in Castro.
   This enables writing *dimension agnostic code*. There are many
   other approaches that will pass only the ``DIM`` values of
   ``lo`` and ``hi`` using alternate macros in ``ArrayLim.H``.

-  ``fab.dataPtr()`` returns a ``double *``—a pointer to the
   data region. This is what is passed to Fortran.

-  ``fab.nComp()`` gives an int—the number of components
   in the ``MultiFab``. This will be used for dimensioning in Fortran.

-  To properly dimension the array in Fortran, we need the actual
   bounds of the data region, including any ghost cells. This is the
   ``Box`` ``abox``, obtained as ``fab.box()``. We pass the
   ``lo`` and ``hi`` of the full data region as well.

To properly compile, we need a prototype for the Fortran
function. These are placed in the ``*_F.H`` files in the
``Castro/Source/`` directory. Here’s the prototype for
our function:

.. code:: c++

      void do_work
        (const int* lo, const int* hi,
         Real* state, const Real& ncomp
         const int* s_lo, const int* s_hi)

A few comments on the prototype:

-  we use the ``const`` qualifier on the many of the arguments.
   This indicates that the data that is pointed to cannot be
   modified [2]_, but the
   contents of the memory space that they point to can be modified.

-  For ``ncomp``, we in the calling sequence, we just did
   ``fab.nComp()``. This returns a ``int``. But Fortran is a
   pass-by-reference language, so we make the argument in the prototype
   a reference. This ensures that it is passed by reference.

In our Fortran example, we want to loop over all of the data,
including 1 ghost cell all around. The corresponding Fortran function
will look like:

.. code:: fortran

      subroutine do_work(lo, hi, &
                         state, ncomp, &
                         s_lo, s_hi) bind(C, name="do_work")

        use prob_params_module, only : dg

        integer, intent(in) :: lo(3), hi(3)
        integer, intent(in) :: s_lo(3), s_hi(3), ncomp

        real (kind=dp_t), intent(inout) :: state(s_lo(1):s_hi(1), &
                                                 s_lo(2):s_hi(2), &
                                                 s_lo(3):s_hi(3), ncomp)

        ! loop over the data
        do k = lo(3)-1*dg(3), hi(3)+1*dg(3)
           do j = lo(2)-1*dg(2), hi(2)+1*dg(2)
              do i = lo(1)-1*dg(1), hi(1)+1*dg(1)

                 ! work on state(i,j,k,:), where the last index
                 ! is the component of the multifab

              enddo
           enddo
        enddo

      end subroutine do_work

Finally, comments on the Fortran routine;

-  We use the Fortran 2003 ``bind`` keyword to specify
   that we want this to be interoperable with C. Ordinarily
   we would not need to specify the optional argument name
   in the binding, but the PGI compiler requires this if our
   Fortran subroutine is part of a module.

-  We dimension state using ``s_lo`` and ``s_hi`` —these are
   the bounds we got from the ``FArrayBox``, and are for the entire data
   region, including ghost cells.

   .. note :: In Fortran, the spatial indices of state don’t
      necessarily start at 1—they reflect the global index space for
      the entire domain at this level of refinement. This means that
      we know where the box is located.

   Later we’ll see how to compute the spatial coordinates using this
   information.

-  Our loop uses ``lo`` and ``hi``—these are the indices
   of the valid data region (no ghost cells). Since we want a single
   ghost cell all around, we subtract 1 from ``lo`` and add 1
   to ``hi``.

   Finally, since this is dimension-agnostic code (it should work
   correctly in 1-, 2-, and 3D), we need to ensure the loops over the
   higher dimensions do nothing when we compile for a lower
   dimensionality. This is the role of ``dg``—dg is 1
   if our simulation includes that spatial dimension and 0
   otherwise.

   If we were not looping over ghost cells too, then we would not need
   to invoke ``dg``, since ``lo`` and ``hi`` are both set to
   0 for any dimensions not represented in our simulation.

Up to this point, we have not said anything about threading. In this
style of using the MFIter, we implement the OpenMP in Fortran, for
instance by putting a pragma around the outer loop in this example.

.. _sec:amrex1:

AMReX’s Current Tiling Approach In C++
--------------------------------------

There are two types of tiling that people discuss. In *logical
tiling*, the data storage in memory is unchanged from how we do things
now in pure MPI. In a given box, the data region is stored
contiguously). But when we loop in OpenMP over a box, the tiling
changes how we loop over the data. The alternative is called
*separate tiling*—here the data storage in memory itself is changed
to reflect how the tiling will be performed. This is not considered
in AMReX.

We have recently introduced logical tiling into parts of AMReX.  It
is off by default, to make the transition smooth and because not
everything should be tiled. It can be enabled on a loop-by-loop basis
by setting an optional argument to ``MFIter``. We demonstrate this
below. Further examples can be found at ``amrex/Tutorials/Tiling_C``,
and ``amrex/Src/LinearSolvers/C_CellMG/``.

In our logical tiling approach, a box is logically split into tiles,
and a ``MFIter`` loops over each tile in each box. Note that the
non-tiling iteration approach can be considered as a special case of
tiling with the tile size equal to the box size.

Let us consider an example. Suppose there are four boxes—see
:numref:`fig:domain-tiling`.

.. _fig:domain-tiling:
.. figure:: domain-tile.png
   :alt: tiling of the domain

   A simple domain showing 4 Boxes labeled 0–3, and their tiling
   regions (dotted lines)

The first box is divided into 4 logical tiles, the second and third
are divided into 2 tiles each (because they are small), and the fourth
into 4 tiles. So there are 12 tiles in total. The difference between
the tiling and non-tiling version are then:

-  In the tiling version, the loop body will be run 12 times. Note
   that ``tilebox`` is different for each tile, whereas ``fab``
   might be referencing the same object if the tiles belong to the same
   box.

-  In the non-tiling version (by constructing ``MFIter`` without
   the optional second argument or setting to false), the loop
   body will be run 4 times because there are four boxes, and a call to
   ``mfi.tilebox()`` will return the traditional ``validbox``. The
   non-tiling case is essentially having one tile per box.

The tiling implementation of the same call to our the Fortran
do_work routine is show below:

.. code:: c++

      bool tiling = true;
      for (MFIter mfi(mf, tiling); mfi.isValid(); ++mfi) // Loop over tiles
      {
        // Get the index space of this iteration.
        const Box& box = mfi.growntilebox(1);

        // Get a reference to the FAB, which contains data and box
        FArrayBox& fab = mf[mfi];

        // Get the index space for the data pointed by the double*.
        const Box& abox = fab.box();

        // We can now pass the information to a Fortran routine.
        do_work(ARLIM_3D(box.loVect()), ARLIM_3D(box.hiVect()),
                fab.dataPtr(), fab.nComp(),
                ARLIM_3D(abox.loVect()), ARLIM_3D(abox.hiVect())

      }

Note that the code is almost identical to the one in § :ref:`sec:amrex0`.
Some comments:

-  The iterator now takes an extra argument to turn on tiling (set
   to ``true``).

   There is another interface fo ``MFIter`` that can take an
   ``IntVect`` that explicitly gives the tile size in each coordinate
   direction. If we don’t explictly specify the tile size at the loop,
   then the runtime parameter ``fabarray.mfiter_tile_size``
   can be used to set it globally.

-  ``.validBox()`` has the same meaning as in the non-tile
   approach, so we don’t use it.
   Since in this example, we want to include a single ghost cell in our
   loop over the data, we use ``.growntilebox(1)`` (where the 1
   here indicates a single ghost cell) to get the ``Box`` (and
   corresponding ``lo`` and ``hi``) for the *current tile*, not
   the entire data region. If instead, we just wanted the valid
   region in Fortran, without any ghost cells, we would use
   ``.tilebox()``.

-  When passing into the Fortran routine, we still use the index
   space of the entire ``FArrayBox`` (including ghost cells), as seen in
   the ``abox`` construction. This is needed to properly dimension
   the array in Fortran.

   The Fortran routine will declare a multidimensional array that is of
   the same size as the entire box, but only work on the index space
   identified by the tile-box (``box``).

The Fortran code is almost the same as before, but now our loop
simply uses ``lo`` and ``hi``, since, by construction with
``.growntilebox(1)``, this already includes the single ghost cell
all around:

.. code:: fortran

      subroutine do_work(lo, hi, &
                         state, ncomp, &
                         s_lo, s_hi) bind(C, name="do_work")

        integer, intent(in) :: lo(3), hi(3)
        integer, intent(in) :: s_lo(3), s_hi(3), ncomp

        real (kind=dp_t), intent(inout) :: state(s_lo(1):s_hi(1), &
                                                 s_lo(2):s_hi(2), &
                                                 s_lo(3):s_hi(3), ncomp)

        ! loop over the data
        do k = lo(3), hi(3)
           do j = lo(2), hi(2)
              do i = lo(1), hi(1)

                 ! work on state(i,j,k,:), where the last index
                 ! is the component of the multifab

              enddo
           enddo
        enddo

      end subroutine do_work

The function prototype is unchanged.

Tiling provides us the opportunity of a coarse-grained approach for
OpenMP. Threading can be turned on by inserting the following line
above the for (``MFIter``...) line::

      #pragma omp parallel

Note that the OpenMP pragma does not have a for—this is not
used when working with an iterator.

Assuming four threads are used in the above example, thread 0 will
work on 3 tiles from the first box, thread 1 on 1 tile from the first
box and 2 tiles from the second box, and so forth. Note that
OpenMP can be used even when tiling is turned off. In that case, the
OpenMP granularity is at the box level (and good performance would need
many boxes per MPI task).

The tile size for the three spatial dimensions can be set by a
parameter, e.g., ``fabarray.mfiter_tile_size = 1024000 8 8``. A
huge number like 1024000 will turn off tiling in that direction.
As noted above, the ``MFIter`` constructor can also take an explicit
tile size: ``MFIter(mfi(mf,IntVect(128,16,32)))``.

Note that tiling can naturally transition from all threads working
on a single box to each thread working on a separate box as the boxes
coarsen (e.g., in multigrid).

The MFIter class provides some other useful functions:

-  ``mfi.validbox()`` : The same meaning as before independent of tiling.

-  ``mfi.tilebox()`` : The standard way of getting the bounds of the
   current tile box. This will tile over the valid data region only.

-  ``mfi.growntilebox(int)`` : A grown tile box that includes
   ghost cells at box boundaries only. Thus the returned boxes for a
   ``FArrayBox`` are non-overlapping.

-  ``mfi.nodaltilebox(int)`` : Returns non-overlapping
   edge-type boxes for tiles. The argument is for direction.

-  ``mfi.fabbox()`` : Same as ``mf[mfi].box()``.

Finally we note that tiling is not always desired or better. The
traditional fine-grained approach coupled with dynamic scheduling is
more appropriate for work with unbalanced loads, such as chemistry
burning in cells by an implicit solver. Tiling can also create extra
work in the ghost cells of tiles.

Practical Details in Working with Tiling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With tiling, the OpenMP is now all in C++, and not in Fortran for all
modules except reactions and ``initdata``.

It is the responsibility of the coder to make sure that the routines
within a tiled region are safe to use with OpenMP. In particular,
note that:

-  tile boxes are non-overlapping

-  the union of tile boxes completely cover the valid region of the
   fab

-  Consider working with a node-centered MultiFab, ``ugdnv``, and
   a cell-centered ``MultiFab`` ``s``:

   -  with ``mfi(s)``, the tiles are based on the cell-centered
      index space. If you have an :math:`8\times 8` box, then and 4 tiles,
      then your tiling boxes will range from :math:`0\rightarrow 3`,
      :math:`4\rightarrow 7`.

   -  with ``mfi(ugdnv)``, the tiles are based on nodal indices,
      so your tiling boxes will range from :math:`0\rightarrow 3`,
      :math:`4\rightarrow 8`.

-  When updating routines to work with tiling, we need to
   understand the distinction between the index-space of the entire box
   (which corresponds to the memory layout) and the index-space of the
   tile.

   -  In the C++ end, we pass (sometimes via the
      ``BL_TO_FORTRAN()`` macro) the ``loVect`` and ``hiVect`` of the
      entire box (including ghost cells). These are then used to
      allocate the array in Fortran as::

            double precision :: a(a_l1:a_h1, a_l2:a_h2, ...)

      When tiling is used, we do not want to loop as do ``a_l1``,
      ``a_h1``, but instead we need to loop over the tiling region. The
      indices of the tiling region need to be passed into the Fortran
      routine separately, and they come from the ``mfi.tilebox()``
      or ``mfi.growntilebox()`` statement.

   -  In Fortran, when initializing an array to 0, do so only
      over the tile region, not for the entire box. For a Fortran array
      a, this means we cannot do::

            a = 0.0
            a(:,:,:,:) = 0.0

      but instead must do::

            a(lo(1):hi(1),lo(2):hi(2),lo(3):hi(3),:) = 0.0

      where ``lo()`` and ``hi()`` are the index-space for the tile box
      returned from ``mfi.tilebox()`` in C++ and passed into the Fortran
      routine.

   -  Look at ``r_old_s`` in ``Exec/gravity_tests/DustCollapse/probdata.f90`` as an
      example of how to declare a ``threadprivate`` variable—this is then used
      in ``sponge_nd.f90``.

Boundaries: ``FillPatch`` and ``FillPatchIterator``
===================================================

AMReX calls the act of filling ghost cells a *fillpatch*
operation. Boundaries between grids are of two types. The first we
call “fine-fine”, which is two grids at the same level. The second
type is "coarse-fine", which needs interpolation from the coarse grid
to fill the fine grid ghost cells. Both of these are part of the
fillpatch operation. Fine-fine fills are just a straight copy from
“valid regions” to ghost cells. Coarse-fine fills are enabled
because the ``StateData`` is not just arrays, they’re “State Data”,
which means that the data knows how to interpolate itself (in an
anthropomorphical sense). The type of interpolation to use is defined
in ``Castro_setup.cpp``—search for
``cell_cons_interp``, for example—that’s “cell conservative
interpolation”, i.e., the data is cell-based (as opposed to
node-based or edge-based) and the interpolation is such that the
average of the fine values created is equal to the coarse value from
which they came. (This wouldn’t be the case with straight linear
interpolation, for example.)

Additionally, since ``StateData`` has an old and new timelevel,
the fill patch operation can interpolate to an intermediate time.

Examples
--------

To illustrate the various ways we fill ghost cells and use the data,
let’s consider the following scenarios:

-  *You have state data that was defined with no ghost cells. You
   want to create a new* ``MultiFab`` *containing a copy of that data with*
   ``NGROW`` *ghost cells.*

   This is the case with ``Sborder`` —the ``MultiFab`` of the
   hydrodynamic state that we use to kick-off the hydrodynamics
   advance.

   ``Sborder`` is declared in ``Castro.H`` simply as:

   .. code:: c++

         Multifab Sborder;

   It is then allocated in ``Castro::initialize_do_advance()``

   .. code:: c++

         Sborder.define(grids, NUM_STATE, NUM_GROW, Fab_allocate);
         const Real prev_time = state[State_Type].prevTime();
         expand_state(Sborder, prev_time, NUM_GROW);

   Note in the call to ``.define()``, we tell AMReX to already
   allocate the data regions for the ``FArrayBox`` s that are part of
   ``Sborder``.

   The actually filling of the ghost cells is done by
   ``Castro::expand_state()``:

   .. code:: c++

         AmrLevel::FillPatch(*this, Sborder, NUM_GROW,
                             prev_time, State_Type, 0, NUM_STATE);

   Here, we are filling the ng ghost cells of ``MultiFab``
   ``Sborder`` at time prev_time. We are using the
   ``StateData`` that is part of the current ``Castro`` object that we
   are part of. Note: ``FillPatch`` takes an object reference as its
   first argument, which is the object that contains the relevant
   ``StateData`` —that is what the this pointer indicates.
   Finally, we are copying the ``State_Type`` data components 0 to
   ``NUM_STATE`` [3]_.

   The result of this operation is that ``Sborder`` will now have
   ``NUM_GROW`` ghost cells consistent with the ``State_Type``
   data at the old time-level.

-  *You have state data that was defined with* ``NGROW`` *ghost
   cells. You want to ensure that the ghost cells are filled
   (including any physical boundaries) with valid data.*

   This is very similar to the procedure shown above. The main
   difference is that for the ``MultiFab`` that will be the target
   of the ghost cell filling, we pass in a reference to the ``StateData`` itself.

   The main thing you need to be careful of here, is that you
   need to ensure that the the time you are at is consistent with
   the ``StateData`` ’s time. Here’s an example from the radiation
   portion of the code ``MGFLDRadSolver.cpp``:

   .. code:: c++

         Real time = castro->get_state_data(Rad_Type).curTime();
         MultiFab& S_new = castro->get_new_data(State_Type);

         AmrLevel::FillPatch(*castro, S_new, ngrow, time, State_Type,
                             0, S_new.nComp(), 0);

   In this example, ``S_new`` is a pointer to the new-time-level
   ``State_Type`` ``MultiFab``. So this operation will use the
   ``State_Type`` data to fill its own ghost cells. we fill the
   ``ngrow`` ghost cells of the new-time-level ``State_Type`` data,
   for all the components.

   Note that in this example, because the ``StateData`` lives in the
   ``castro`` object and we are working from the ``Radiation`` object,
   we need to make reference to the current ``castro`` object
   pointer. If this were all done within the ``castro`` object, then
   the pointer will simply be ``this``, as we saw above.

-  *You have a* ``MultiFab`` *with some derived quantity. You want to
   fill its ghost cells.*

   ``MultiFabs`` have a ``FillBoundary()`` method that will fill all
   the ghost cells between boxes at the same level. It will not fill
   ghost cells at coarse-fine boundaries or at physical boundaries.

-  *You want to loop over the FABs in state data, filling ghost cells
   along the way*

   This is the job of the ``FillPatchIterator``—this iterator is used
   to loop over the grids and fill ghostcells. A key thing to keep in
   mind about the ``FillPatchIterator`` is that you operate on a copy of
   the data—the data is disconnected from the original source. If you
   want to update the data in the source, you need to explicitly copy
   it back. Also note: ``FillPatchIterator`` takes a ``MultiFab``, but this is
   not filled—this is only used to get the grid layout. Finally, the
   way the ``FillPatchIterator`` is implemented is that all the
   communication is done first, and then the iterating over boxes
   commences.

   For example, the loop that calls ``CA_UMDRV`` (all the
   hydrodynamics integration stuff) starts with::

          for (FillPatchIterator fpi(*this, S_new, NUM_GROW,
                                     time, State_Type, strtComp, NUM_STATE);
                fpi.isValid(); ++fpi)
          {
            FArrayBox &state = fpi();
            Box bx(fpi.validbox());

            // work on the state FAB.  The interior (valid) cells will
            // live between bx.loVect() and bx.hiVect()
          }

   Here the ``FillPatchIterator`` is the thing that distributes the
   grids over processors and makes parallel “just work”. This fills the
   single patch ``fpi`` , which has ``NUM_GROW`` ghost cells,
   with data of type ``State_Type`` at time ``time``,
   starting with component strtComp and including a total of
   ``NUM_STATE`` components.

In general, one should never assume that ghostcells are valid, and
instead do a fill patch operation when in doubt. Sometimes we will
use a ``FillPatchIterator`` to fill the ghost cells into a ``MultiFab``
without an explict look. This is done as::

      FillPatchIterator fpi(*this,S_old,1,time,State_Type,0,NUM_STATE);
      MultiFab& state_old = fpi.get_mf();

In this operation, state_old points to the internal
``MultiFab`` in the ``FillPatchIterator``, by getting a reference to it as
``fpi.get_mf()``. This avoids a local copy.

Note that in the examples above, we see that only ``StateData`` can fill
physical boundaries (because these register how to fill the boundaries
when they are defined). There are some advanced operations in
AMReX that can get around this, but we do not use them in Castro.

.. _soft:phys_bcs:

Physical Boundaries
-------------------

.. index:: boundary conditions

Physical boundary conditions are specified by an integer index [4]_ in
the ``inputs`` file, using the ``castro.lo_bc`` and ``castro.hi_bc`` runtime
parameters. The generally supported boundary conditions are, their
corresponding integer key, and the action they take for the normal
velocity, transverse velocity, and generic scalar are shown in 
:numref:`table:castro:bcs`.

The definition of the specific actions are:

-  ``INT_DIR``: data taken from other grids or interpolated

-  ``EXT_DIR``: data specified on EDGE (FACE) of bndry

-  ``HOEXTRAP``: higher order extrapolation to EDGE of bndry

-  ``FOEXTRAP``: first order extrapolation from last cell in interior

-  ``REFLECT_EVEN``: :math:`F(-n) = F(n)` true reflection from interior cells

-  ``REFLECT_ODD``: :math:`F(-n) = -F(n)` true reflection from interior cells

The actual registration of a boundary condition action to a particular
variable is done in ``Castro_setup.cpp``. At the top we define arrays
such as ``scalar_bc``, ``norm_vel_bc``, etc, which say which kind of
bc to use on which kind of physical boundary.  Boundary conditions are
set in functions like ``set_scalar_bc``, which uses the ``scalar_bc``
pre-defined arrays. We also specify the name of the Fortran routine
that is responsible for filling the data there (e.g., ``hypfill``).  These
routines are discussed more below.

If you want to specify a value at a function (like at an inflow
boundary), then you choose an *inflow* boundary at that face of
the domain. You then need to write the implementation code for this.
There is a centralized hydrostatic boundary condition that is implemented
this way—see :ref:`create:bcs`.

``FluxRegister``
----------------

A ``FluxRegister`` holds face-centered data at the boundaries of a box.
It is composed of a set of ``MultiFab`` s (one for each face, so 6 for
3D). A ``FluxRegister`` stores fluxes at coarse-fine interfaces,
and isused for the flux-correction step.

Other AMReX Concepts
====================

There are a large number of classes that help define the structure of
the grids, metadata associate with the variables, etc. A good way to
get a sense of these is to look at the ``.H`` files in the
``amrex/Src/`` directory.

``Geometry`` class
------------------

There is a ``Geometry`` object, ``geom`` for each level as part of
the ``Castro`` object (this is inhereted through ``AmrLevel``).

``ParmParse`` class
-------------------

Error Estimators
----------------

``Gravity`` class
=================

There is a single ``Gravity`` object, ``gravity``, that is a
static class member of the ``Castro`` object. This means that all
levels refer to the same ``Gravity`` object.

Within the ``Gravity`` object, there are pointers to the ``Amr``
object (as ``parent``), and all of the ``AmrLevels`` (as a ``PArray``,
``LevelData``). The ``gravity`` object gets the geometry
information at each level through the parent ``Amr`` class.

The main job of the ``gravity`` object is to provide the potential
and gravitation acceleration for use in the hydrodynamic sources.
Depending on the approximation used for gravity, this could mean
calling the AMReX multigrid solvers to solve the Poisson equation.

Fortran Helper Modules
======================

There are a number of modules that make data available to the Fortran
side of Castroor perform other useful tasks.

``amrex_constants_module``
--------------------------

This provides double precision constants as Fortran parameters, like
``ZERO``, ``HALF``, and ``ONE``.

``extern_probin_module``
------------------------

This module provides access to the runtime parameters for the
microphysics routines (EOS, reaction network, etc.). The source for
this module is generated at compile type via a make rule that invokes
a python script. This will search for all of the ``_parameters`` files
in the external sources, parse them for runtime parameters, and build
the module.

``fundamental_constants_module``
--------------------------------

This provides the CGS values of many physical constants.


``meth_params_module``
----------------------

This module provides the integer keys used to access the state arrays
for both the conserved variables (``URHO``, ``UMX``, :math:`\ldots`)
and primitive variables (``QRHO``, ``QU``, :math:`\ldots`), as well as
the number of scalar variables.

It also provides the values of most of the ``castro.*xxxx*``
runtime parameters.



.. _soft:prob_params:

``prob_params_module``
----------------------

This module stores information about the domain and current level, and
is periodically synced up with the C++ driver. The information
available here is:

   -  ``physbc_lo``, ``physbc_hi``: these are the boundary
      condition types at the low and high ends of the domain, for each
      coordinate direction. Integer keys, ``Interior``, ``Inflow``,
      ``Outflow``, ``Symmetry``, ``SlipWall``, and
      ``NoSlipWall`` allow you to interpret the values.

   -  ``center`` is the center of the problem. Note—this is up
      to the problem setup to define (in the ``probinit`` subroutine).
      Alternately, it can be set at runtime via
      ``castro.center``.

      Usually ``center`` will be the physical center of the domain,
      but not always. For instance, for axisymmetric problems,
      center may be on the symmetry axis.

      ``center`` is used in the multipole gravity, hybrid advection
      algorithm, rotation sources, for the point mass gravity, in
      defining the center of the sponge, and in deriving the radial
      velocity.

   -  ``coord_type``

   -  ``dim``

   -  ``dg``

   -  *refining information*



.. [1]
   Note: some older code will use a special AMReX preprocessor macro,
   ``BL_TO_FORTRAN``, defined in ``ArrayLim.H``, that converts
   the C++ ``MultiFab`` into a Fortran array and its ``lo`` and ``hi`` indices.
   Additionally, some older code will wrap the Fortran subroutine name
   in an additional preprocessor macro, ``BL_FORT_PROC_CALL``
   to handle the name mangling between Fortran and C. This later
   macro is generally not needed any more because of Fortran 2003
   interoperability with C (through the Fortran ``bind`` keyword).

.. [2]
   the way to read these complicated
   C declarations is right-to-left. So ``const int* lo`` means
   ``lo`` is a integer pointer to a memory space that is constant. See
   https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/const-correctness#ptr-to-const
