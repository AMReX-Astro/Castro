Construction of the logo:

1. create a bitmap slice of the wdmerger simulation using the script
   logo.py

2. Use gimp to resize the image to just the interactive stars (cutting
   out the axes).  Use "image -> crop to selection".

3. Open inkscape and import the image -- use "file -> import..."

4. Select the image and use "path -> trace bitmap..."

   Set it to "colors" and check the "remove background" box.

5. Select the largest element and resize the canvas using "edit -> resize page to selection"
