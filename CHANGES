# changes since the last release:

  -- the Source/ directory structure has been reorganized,
     putting the source files into directories by physics and
     eliminating the Src_1d, Src_2d, ... subdirectories

  -- the Riemann solvers have been merged into a single
     dimensional-agnostic version in Src_nd.  In 2-d there was an
     issue with how the Godunov state for the CG solver was stored on
     interfaces, which would affect the internal enery evolution.

  -- the PLM and PPM reconstruction routines were merged into
     a single dimensional-agnostic version in hydro/

  -- the characteristic tracing routines were merged into
     dimensional-agnostic versions in hydro/ and radiation/.  This
     change fixed and outstanding issue -- the PLM reconstruction in
     1-d now uses a reference state. (issue #11)

# 17.08

  -- the option castro.limit_fluxes_on_small_dens now only limits
     on density as the name suggests. It originally also limited
     fluxes if the internal energy would go negative, but this
     caused problems in runs with MPI, so it was removed. It was
     not strictly needed anyway, as the normal logic for handling
     negative internal energies is reliable.

  -- two errors were fixed in the implementation of the triggered
     regrid at the end of a timestep. The method now correctly conserves
     fluid variables at coarse-fine boundaries.

  -- the XGRAPH stuff that output xmgr-compatible 1-d ASCII profiles

  -- fixed a bug where the gravity runtime parameters were not
     being properly initialized in the Fortran side of the code.

  -- the viscosity routine is now separate from conductivity
     in Microphysics/.  Also, Castro can now use the stellar
     conductivity that is part of StarKiller.

  -- the StarKiller-astro Microphysics repo now uses a denser table
     for the Helmholtz EOS (thanks to Frank Timmes).  If you are using
     this EOS, the new table will be soft-linked to your build
     directory automatically.  If you have an old copy laying around,
     it might fail to run, with an I/O error.

# 17.07

  -- start of some code cleaning for eventual GPU offload support
     merging from StarLord

  -- added a framework for method-of-lines integration of the
     hydrodynamics.  This does not do characteristic tracing, but
     instead does reconstruction through multiple stages of an ODE
     integrator.  At the moment, radiation is not supported.

# 17.06

  -- we now require the AMReX library instead of the BoxLib library

  -- the Microphysics repository that we rely on for the EOS and
     reaction networks is now part of the starkiller-astro github.
     You can change your clone to refer to this via:

     git remote set-url origin ssh://git@github.com/starkiller-astro/Microphysics

  -- a new mechanism for using a stability criterion to trigger
     a regrid at the end of a timestep was added (PR #122)

  -- some cleaning of the logic for momentum fluxes and
     limit_hydro_fluxes_on_small_dens (issues #130, #131)

# 17.05

  -- some protections added in the retry code


# 17.04

  -- rewrote the conservative gravity formulation to work off of the
     potential.  This gives the best conservation with AMR.  This is
     equivalent to the description in Appendix B from Katz et
     al. (2016).


# 17.03

  -- the new refluxing method introduced in 16.11 has been removed,
     as it was determined to not provide any benefit in accuracy.

  -- new derived plot variables are available when using thermal
     diffusion, including the conductivity, diffusion coefficient, and
     the entire diffusion term to the energy equation.  (issue #104)

  -- when all derived variables were stored in the plotfile, we were
     storing the mass fractions twice.  E.g. for he4, we were saving
     "he4" and "X(he4)".  Now only the latter is stored.

  -- created a post_simulation() function that is called at the end of
     a simulation.  An example is provided by test_diffusion where we
     output the norm of the error against the analytic solution.
     (issue #107, 108)


# 17.02

  -- diagnostic information about how source terms update the state
     has been overhauled and made uniform. All source terms, including
     hydro and resets, print their changes to the state in the same
     format. The parameter print_energy_diagnostics has been renamed
     print_update_diagnostics, and a new parameter
     coalesce_update_diagnostics has been added so that you can
     combine all of the old-time and new-time updates into one print.
     (issue #58)

  -- to support both single and double precision, all of the floating
     point declarations use the amrex_real type defined in the
     amrex_fort_module -- this is set to single or double precision at
     compile time.  All constants also now use this type.  For
     brevity, we rename it to 'rt' in the use statement.  (issue #34)

  -- the sponge is now time-centered by default (issue #7)

  -- the ppm_temp_fix stuff has been documented and made
     consistent across dimensions (issue #25)

  -- the job info git information is now the output of git describe,
     this gives more information, including the last tag, how far we
     are from the tag, and an abbreviated hash.  It also indicates if
     your working directory is dirty


* 17.01

  -- the radiation-specific version of computeTemp has been removed
     and instead everything goes through the main Castro computeTemp.
     This affects, in particular, how we treated small internal
     energies in radiation. (issue #64)

  -- the radiation-specific versions of umeth and consup have been
     merged with the pure hydro routines.  This gives round-off level
     differences.  This also now uses all velocity components in the
     kinetic energy correction for radiation. (issues #66, 70)

  -- a minor bug was fixed in the 3-d radiation characteristic tracing,
     regarding which gamma_1 (gamc) is used.


* 16.12a

  -- fix a restart bug with radiation that was introduced after 16.10
     (this was cherry-picked from development) (issues #76, 78)

* 16.12

  -- BoxLib now requires a C++ 11 compiler by default.  As part of
     this transition, PArrays are replaced by C++ Arrays.
     Additionally, changes to the BoxLib build system mean that we
     only need to supple COMP for the compiler.  FCOMP is now
     ignored.

  -- The User's Guide has been updated to reflect the current flow of
     the algorithm.

* 16.11

  -- we now distinguish between gravity (which can include a
     constant gravitational acceleration) and self-gravity,
     with the GRAVITY and SELF_GRAVITY preprocessor directives

  -- some work on the sync between levels was done -- this will
     be described in a forthcoming paper. The main change by default
     is that after a reflux, we recompute the value of the source terms
     on the affected levels so that the new-time source term knows about
     the updated state due to the flux. For gravity, this resembles
     what the original Castro paper described for a sync source, but this
     is now done in a consistent way for all source terms. This should be fairly
     cheap which is why it is enabled by default, but you can disable it
     (see castro.update_sources_after_reflux). An additional optional
     change is a new strategy for refluxing (see castro.reflux_strategy).
     In the existing standard method, we only reflux after all fine timesteps
     over a coarse timestep have completed. In the new method, we do a
     partial reflux at the end of each fine timestep. This means that
     the coarse state used in time interpolation for the fine level
     is slightly more accurate as we go for later fine timesteps. It
     should also be needed for self-consistently conserving energy for gravity.
     At present it is more expensive than the standard method when there
     are gravity sync solves because there are more of them, but the tradeoff
     is that the simulation is more accurate.

  -- the order of computing the temperature and reseting internal
     energy was changed in a few spots. This will change results by default.

  -- the radiation-specific source was moved into the Radiation/
     subdirectory

* 16.10

  -- the parameter first_order_hydro has been moved from the
     radiation namespace to the castro namespace

  -- the problem setups have been moved into sub-directory
     categories to make it easier to read (issue #32)

  -- the way we we use tolerances in the multigrid solve for Poisson
     gravity has changed. The old behavior is that you would pass in
     gravity.ml_tol as the relative tolerance on each grid level, and
     absolute tolerances would not be used. This suffered from some
     defects, notably that on fine grids you often had to loosen the
     relative tolerance on each higher level to achieve convergence,
     and in certain cases the scheme would fail completely, for
     example if the fine grids were not covering the mass on the
     grid. We now use an input parameter gravity.abs_tol which
     controls the absolute scale of the tolerance. This can either be
     an array of values, one for each level, or a single scalar
     value. If it is the latter, then the absolute tolerance passed
     into the multigrid scheme is the tolerance multiplied by the
     maximum value of the RHS over the entire domain.  On the coarse
     grid, then, the absolute tolerance is 4*pi*G*rho_max*abs_tol, and
     on fine grids this is multiplied by ref_ratio**2. If you do not
     specify gravity.abs_tol, then a reasonable value is selected for
     the coarse level, and the same scheme is used to give it
     reasonable values on the fine levels as well. The parameter
     gravity.ml_tol has been renamed gravity.rel_tol, and has the same
     meaning as before, but it now defaults to zero. gravity.ml_tol is
     now deprecated, and will be removed in a future release. Note
     that the tolerance used in determining convergence is always the
     less restrictive of the relative and absolute tolerance
     requirements.  gravity.delta_tol has been removed. (issue #43)

  -- the radiation hydro solver, that used to live in
     CastroRadiation.git has now been completely integrated into the
     main Castro git repo.  The history was preserved in the
     transition It has also been cleaned up a little (issues #24, #31,
     #33, #48)

     The radiation build variable Network_inputs was renamed
     to NETWORK_INPUTS for consistency.

     The EOSes that used to come with CastroRadiation are available
     in Microphysics.git

  -- the gravity and diffusion runtime parameters have been moved
     to the master _cpp_parameters file (issue #42)

  -- enthalpy, species, and temperature diffusion are now properly
     time-centered (issue #22), and a bug in the hi boundary
     inflow boundary conditions for diffusion was fixed (issue #41)

  -- a flux limiter has been added that limits the size of the hydro
     fluxes if they would cause rho or (rho e) to go negative. This
     can be used with castro.limit_hydro_fluxes_on_small_dens = 1.

  -- a bug for single-level problems with Poisson gravity has been
     fixed where the multi-grid tolerance was being set to an
     uninitialized value

  -- a flaw in the source terms for the primitive variables in the
     hydro update has been fixed, so that source terms like gravity
     should no longer affect the pressure and (rho e) interface states
     (issue #19)

  -- the prediction of source terms to the half-time used in the
     hydrodynamics reconstruction was not being done properly.
     This has been fixed (issue #18)

  -- the radiation hydro ppm now implements the ppm_predict_gammae
     option

  -- we no longer ship VODE or BLAS with Castro -- these are provided
     by the separate Microphysics git repo

  -- the documentation of the architecture of Castro has been
     significantly improved (issues #20, #23, #29, #31)

* 16.09:

  -- the PPM tracing routine for radiation was synced up with the pure
     hydro version.  In particular, it now supports ppm_trace_sources,
     implements the reference states and fixes an issue with the
     flattening.

  -- The 1-d PPM routine was also updated to support tracing,
     predicting gamma_e instead of (rho e), and an inconsistency in
     the flattening was fixed.

  -- the parameters ppm_reference and ppm_reference_edge_limit
     have been removed -- there was no reason to use anything other
     than the defaults

  -- the parameter ppm_tau_in_tracing has been removed.  The useful
     part of this is preserved in the ppm_predict_gammae = 1
     functionality, which uses a different set of primitive variables
     (tau, u, p, gamma_e) in the prediction of the interface states.

  -- the flux correction for axisymmetric and 1-d spherical coords
     has been fixed.  In particular, there is now a separate flux
     register for the pressure term that enters as a gradient in the
     momentum equation.

  -- The sign on the gravitational potential has been flipped to be
     consistent with the usual convention in the physics literature,
     i.e. the potential is negative and we solve del**2 phi = 4 * pi *
     G * rho.

  -- Castro_advance.cpp has been significantly cleaned up. Each source
     term (gravity, rotation, diffusion, etc.) has a MultiFab
     associated with it through which it affects the state data. This
     has changed results slightly (typically a relative change no
     larger than the 1e-4 level) due to updates in the order of
     operations and consistency in usage on ghost zones.

  -- An iterative solver for coupling between reactions and
     hydrodynamics has been introduced, which you can enable with
     USE_SDC = TRUE in the makefile. The number of iterations done for
     each timestep is controlled with castro.sdc_max_iters.

  -- We changed the defaults for the gravity and rotation sources.
     now we do grav_source_type and rot_source_type = 4 by default.
     This is a conservative formulation for the energy equation that
     incorporates the source as a flux in the energy equation.  See
     Katz et al. 2016 for details.

     We also do implicit_rotation_update = 1 by default -- this does a
     slightly better coupling of the Coriolis force in the momentum
     equation by doing an implicit velocity update

     We also make ppm_trace_sources = 1 the default -- this does
     parabolic reconstruction of the momentum sources and traces
     under them when constructing the interface states

  -- we now set castro.cg_blend = 2 by default.  This has no effect for
     the default CGF Riemann solver, but for the Colella & Glaz solver
     (castro.riemann_solver = 1), this will augment the secant iteration
     for the pstar find with bisection if we fail to converge.  This
     makes the root find for the star state more robust.

  -- a new "fake" setup, riemann_test_zone can be use to send a left /
     right hydro state to the CG Riemann solver for testing -- this acts
     as a unit test for that solver.

  -- the default for castro.allow_negative_energy is now 0 -- this is
     the safer choice.

  -- the default for castro.point_mass_fix_solution was changed to 0
     -- this is a more expected behavior for new users.


* 16.08

  -- A new parameter gravity.max_multipole_moment_level was added.
     This comes into play when using the multipole solver to compute
     the boundary conditions on the domain for isolated mass
     distributions.  The default behavior in Castro when constructing
     boundary conditions for the gravity solve is to do a multipole
     expansion sum over the density on the coarse grid only.  If you
     increase the value of that new parameter from its default of 0 to
     some higher number, it will use the data from those more refined
     levels in constructing the boundary condition values.

  -- The file sponge_nd.f90 in Source/Src_nd/ has been renamed to
     sponge_nd.F90, the file extension change indicating that it can
     now be run through the preprocessor. Please update your local
     name for this file if you're overriding it in your problem setup.

  -- The sponge update is usually done in an implicit fashion,
     but you can now instead do an explicit update with
     castro.sponge_implicit == 0.

  -- the shock variable is now output if we are running with shock
     detection enabled

  -- Microphysics/eos is now Microphysics/EOS

  -- a number of changes were done in the Microphysics repo -- see
     Microphysics/CHANGES for a log of those


* 16.07

  -- For consistency across the BoxLib suite of astro codes, we've
     renamed the main environment variables.  CASTRO_HOME now replaces
     CASTRO_DIR; MICROPHYSICS_HOME now replaces MICROPHYSICS_DIR.

  -- The EOS, network, and conductivity routines have been moved to
     sub-directories or Castro/Microphysics/.  This reflects the way
     the layout in the standalone Microphysics repo as well as that in
     Maestro.

  -- Some of the routines in Source/Src_nd/ have been renamed from
     .f90 files to .F90 files so that we can use the preprocessor. If
     you were using any of them (Prob_nd.f90, problem_tagging_nd.f90,
     Rotation_frequency.f90, or ext_src_nd.f90) by having local copies
     in your problem directory that overwrote them, please be sure to
     update the file extension so that Castro will recognize them.

  -- If you were using allow_negative_energy == 0, the case where
     (rho*E), the total gas energy of the zone, was negative was
     indirectly covered and it would be reset in this case due to the
     way the logic worked for resetting the internal energy and then
     updating the total energy to be consistent with it. However at
     one point we added an option castro.dual_energy_update_E_from_e
     which disabled that second update and also meant that negative
     (rho*E) was again possible. This possibility has now been
     precluded directly, by resetting (rho*E) the same way if we
     detect that it is negative. This should not change results unless
     you were using castro.dual_energy_update_E_from_e = 1. This is
     also a good time to plug the newer option
     castro.allow_small_energy, which if set to 1 will reset when you
     hit a (rho*e) that is less than the smallest possible energy for
     the (rho, small_temp, X) in that zone. Note that it requires an
     extra EOS call.

  -- The default interpolation for coarse zones into fine zones is
     piecewise linear.  There is now an option to use piecewise
     constant instead -- set castro.state_interp_order to 0. Note that
     if you use piecewise linear you can set
     castro.lin_limit_state_interp to 1 if you want to preserve linear
     combinations and therefore guarantee that, say, sum(X) = 1.

  -- If you set the new option castro.limit_fluxes_on_small_dens = 1,
     the fluxes will be explicitly limited such that a negative
     density is never created.

  -- Along similar lines, there are also new options for how to reset
     a negative density if one should arise. Set
     castro.density_reset_method = 2 to use the average of all
     adjacent zones instead of the default, which is the
     characteristics of the adjacent zone with the highest
     density. Set it to 3 if you want to reset it to the original zone
     state before the hydro update.

  -- We have fixed an issue where diffusion did not work correctly if
     add_ext_src = 0.  The diffusion source term is now independent of
     whether you have user-defined source terms.

  -- ConvertCheckpoint/ now lives under Util/

  -- UsersGuide/ is now Docs/ -- this is consistent with the other
     BoxLib codes

  -- Burning is no longer done in ghost cells for boundaries with
     neighbors on the same level of refinement.  Instead a ghost cell
     fill is done to fill the like-level neighbor cells.  As a
     consequence of this change, if reset_internal_energy() is invoked
     in a cell, to reset the internal energy to E - K, this reset is
     now reflected in the ghost cells (this is a more consistent
     behavior).  Previously, the energy was never reset in the ghost
     cells.
