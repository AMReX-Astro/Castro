The community of participants in open source astrophysical simulations is
made up of members from around the globe with a diverse set of skills,
personalities, and experiences. It is through these differences that
our community experiences success and continued growth. We expect
everyone in our community to follow these guidelines when interacting
with others both inside and outside of our community. Our goal is to
keep ours a positive, inclusive, successful, and growing community.

As members of the AMReX-Astrophysics community,

* We pledge to treat all people with respect and provide a harassment-
  and bullying-free environment, regardless of sex, sexual orientation
  and/or gender identity, disability, physical appearance, body size,
  race, nationality, ethnicity, and religion. In particular, sexual
  language and imagery, sexist, racist, or otherwise exclusionary
  jokes are not appropriate.

* We pledge to respect the work of others by recognizing
  acknowledgment/citation requests of original authors. As authors, we
  pledge to be explicit about how we want our own work to be cited or
  acknowledged.

* We pledge to welcome those interested in joining the community, and
  realize that including people with a variety of opinions and
  backgrounds will only serve to enrich our community. In particular,
  discussions relating to pros/cons of various technologies,
  programming languages, and so on are welcome, but these should be
  done with respect, taking proactive measure to ensure that all
  participants are heard and feel confident that they can freely
  express their opinions.

* We pledge to welcome questions and answer them respectfully, paying
  particular attention to those new to the community. We pledge to
  provide respectful criticisms and feedback in forums, especially in
  discussion threads resulting from code contributions.

* We pledge to be conscientious of the perceptions of the wider
  community and to respond to criticism respectfully. We will strive
  to model behaviors that encourage productive debate and
  disagreement, both within our community and where we are
  criticized. We will treat those outside our community with the same
  respect as people within our community.

* We pledge to help the entire community follow the code of conduct,
  and to not remain silent when we see violations of the code of
  conduct. We will take action when members of our community violate
  this code such as contacting senior members of the organization (all
  discussions will be treated with the strictest confidence) or
  talking privately with the person.

This code of conduct applies to all community situations online and
offline, including github discussions and issues / PRs, social media,
conferences, meetings, associated social events, and one-to-one
interactions.
