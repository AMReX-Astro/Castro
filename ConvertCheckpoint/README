Instructions:

Let's say you have a checkpoint file, chk00100,  say, with 5 levels of refinement 
and a (real) problem domain size P and (integer) domain size D at level 0.

The inputs file that created this might look like:

****************************************************
max_step      = 100

amr.max_level = 5

amr.n_cell    = D D

amr.ref_ratio = 4 4 4 4

geometry.prob_lo = 0 0
geometry.prob_hi = P P

****************************************************

Now let's suppose that:

1) The star is centered in the corner, i.e. you're only modeling an octant, and 
2) you want to grow the domain by a factor of 8,  and 
3) you want to cover that new larger domain with a level that is a factor of 2 coarser than the existing level 0 grids.

Then you need to:

1) First, set DIM = in the GNUmakefile, and type  "make" in the ConvertCheckpoint directory.
This will make an executable from the Embiggen.cpp code.

2) Run the embiggening code as follows:

Embiggen2d.Linux.Intel.Intel.ex checkin=chk00100 checkout=newchk00050 ref_ratio=2 grown_factor=8

This will create a new checkpoint directory, called newchk00050, that represents a simulation
with *one* additional level of refinement *coarser* than the previous level 0 grids by
a factor of "ref_ratio" (in this case, 2).   The new domain will be a factor of "grown_factor" (in this case, 8)

Note that ref_ratio must be 2 or 4, because those are the only cromulent
values in CASTRO.

grown_factor can be any reasonable integer; I've only tested 2, 3, 4 and 8.  It does not need
to be a multiple of 2.

(You no longer set num_new_levels, that is now hard-wired to one.  You can only add one new level at a time.)

3) Finally ...

  You should now be able to restart your calculation using newchk00050.

  Note that your inputs file now should look something like:

    amr.restart = newchk00050

    amr.regrid_on_restart = 1

    max_step      = 51

    amr.max_level = 6

    amr.n_cell    = 4D 4D

    geometry.prob_lo =  0  0
    geometry.prob_hi = 8P 8P

    castro.grown_factor = 8

    amr.ref_ratio = 2 4 4 4 4

****************************************************

IMPORTANT:

1) You must set max_level to be one greater than before.

2) Set amr.regrid_on_restart = 1 to make sure that the gridding is as you want it 
before you take any timesteps.  The first plotfile generated will show the new grids.

2) You must set amr.n_cell = (grown_factor / ref_ratio) times the previous n_cell.
In this case amr.n_cell = (8/2)*D = 4D.

3) You must set prob_hi to be a factor of grown_factor greater than the previous prob_hi.

4) You must insert the value of "ref_ratio" used in the Embiggen call as the first
value in the list of ref_ratio, since that will now be the ref_ratio between the new level 0
and the new level 1.

5) You must set castro.grown_factor in your inputs file to be the same grown_factor you used
when you called Embiggen*ex so that the CASTRO code knows how big the original domain
was.

6) Note that if you have run 100 steps at the original level 0, that would be equivalent
to 50 steps at the new level 0.  Thus once you re-start from the new checkpoint directory,
the next step will be 51, not 101.  Make sure to keep track of your plotfiles accordingly.

7) Don't forget to adjust max_denerr_lev and comparable variables to control
the number of fine levels you now want.   If you want to have 6 levels of refinement
after restart, then make sure max_denerr_lev, etc, are set high enough.  If you
only want to have 5 levels of refinement (where the new level 5 would now be
a factor of ref_ratio coarser than the previous level 5), make sure to adjust
max_denerr_lev accordingly as well.

****************************************************

Now let's suppose that:

1) The star is centered in the **center** of the domain
2) you want to grow the domain by a factor of 2,  and 
3) you want to cover that new larger domain with a level that is a factor of 2 coarser than the existing level 0 grids.

Then you must modify your call to Embiggen by setting star_at_center = 1 (it defaults to 0), i.e., do

Embiggen2d.Linux.Intel.Intel.ex checkin=chk00100 checkout=newchk00050 ref_ratio=2 grown_factor=2 star_at_center=1

In this case grown_factor can be either 2 or 3.

  Note that your inputs file now should look something like:

    amr.restart = newchk00050

    amr.regrid_on_restart = 1

    max_step      = 51

    amr.max_level = 6

    amr.n_cell    = D D

    geometry.prob_lo = -P/2 -P/2
    geometry.prob_hi = 3P/2 3P/2

    castro.grown_factor = 2

    castro.star_at_center = 1

    amr.ref_ratio = 2 4 4 4 4

****************************************************

NOTE: don't forget to set castro.star_at_center in your inputs file when you restart.

NOTE: when star_at_center = 1, MAKE SURE that you have defined the center of the star
in your subroutine PROBINIT to be 

     center(1) = problo(1) + 0.5d0 * (probhi(1)-problo(1))
     center(2) = problo(2) + 0.5d0 * (probhi(2)-problo(2))

i.e. don't assume that problo is zero.

Also -- in subroutine ca_initdata, make sure that you set 

         x = xlo(1) + (dble(i-lo(1)) + 0.5d0) * delta(1) - center(1)
         y = xlo(2) + (dble(j-lo(2)) + 0.5d0) * delta(2) - center(2)

so that you get the correct values for x and y when prob_lo is not 0.

****************************************************

There appears to be a problem with the PathScale compiler on Franklin in optimized (non-DEBUG)
mode.   The error reveals itself as this process not working on multiple processors.  To get around
this I have added the line
DEFINES += -DBL_USEOLDREADS 
to the GNUmakefile.
